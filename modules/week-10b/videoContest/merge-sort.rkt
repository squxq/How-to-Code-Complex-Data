;; Merge Sort

;; Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the
;; principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list
;; into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and
;; merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. It was
;; invented by John Von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis
;; of bottom-up merge sort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Von Neumann
;; as early as 1948.

;; The concept of Divide and Conquer involves three steps:
;;   1. Divide the problem into multiple subproblems.
;;   2. Solve the Sub Problems. The idea is to break down the problem into
;;      atomic subproblems, where they are actually solved.
;;   3. Combine the solutions of the subproblems to find the solution of the
;;      actual problem.

;; So, the merge sort working rule involves the following steps:
;;   1. Divide the unsorted array into subarray, each containing a single
;;      element.
;;   2. Take adjacent pairs of two single element array and merge them to form
;;      an array of two elements.
;;   3. Repeat the process till a single sorted array is obtained.

;; An array of size, n, is divided into two parts, n/2 size of each. Then those
;; arrays are further divided till we reach a single element. The base case here
;; is reaching one single elemtnt. When the base case is hit, we start merging
;; the left part and the right part and we get a sorted array at the end. Merge
;; sort repeatedly breaks down an array into several subarrays until each
;; subarray consists of a single element and merging those subarrays in a
;; manner that results in a sorted array.

;; Merge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists
;; as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the lements of
;; the inputs lists in sorted order.
