;PROBLEM 1:
; 
; In the lecture videos we designed a function to make a Sierpinski triangle fractal. 
; 
; Here is another geometric fractal that is made of circles rather than triangles:
; 
; (open image file)
; 
; Design a function to create this circle fractal of size n and colour c.

;; =====================
;; Constant Definitions:

(define CUT-OFF 5)
(define CIRCLE-MODE "outline")


;; =====================
;; Function Definitions:

;; Natural String -> Image
;; produce a circle fractal of given size, n, and given colour, c

;; Stub:
#; (define (circle-fractal n c) empty-image)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (circle-fractal CUT-OFF "blue")
              (circle CUT-OFF CIRCLE-MODE "blue"))

; PROBLEM 2:
; 
; Below you will find some data definitions for a tic-tac-toe solver. 
; 
; In this problem we want you to design a function that produces all 
; possible filled boards that are reachable from the current board. 
; 
; In actual tic-tac-toe, O and X alternate playing. For this problem
; you can disregard that. You can also assume that the players keep 
; placing Xs and Os after someone has won. This means that boards that 
; are completely filled with X, for example, are valid.
; 
; Note: As we are looking for all possible boards, rather than a winning 
; board, your function will look slightly different than the solve function 
; you saw for Sudoku in the videos, or the one for tic-tac-toe in the 
; lecture questions.
