;;; produce list with only positive? elements of lon
;
;;; Stub:
;;(define (positive-only lon) empty)
;
;;; Tests:
;(check-expect (positive-only empty) empty)
;(check-expect (positive-only (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list 1 3))
;
;(define (positive-only lon) (filter2 positive? lon))
;
;
;;; ListOfNumber -> ListOfNumber
;;; produce list with only negative? elements of lon
;
;;; Stub:
;;(define (negative-only lon) empty)
;
;;; Tests:
;(check-expect (negative-only empty) empty)
;(check-expect (negative-only (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list -2 -4))

;Continue working on the design of this abstract function by completing the   
;purpose and check-expects for filter2.
