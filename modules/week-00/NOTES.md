## Syllabus

The complete How to Code course consists of 2 parts. Each part is 6 
weeks long, and each week consists of 1 or 2 modules. All of those 
modules have a similar structure, comprised of:

- An overview describing the module learning goals and summarizing the work required to complete the module.
- A number of blended topic lectures, consisting of videoÂ interspersed with questions for you to answer.
- A set of problems that will let you practice the new design techniques before the quiz.
- A module quiz. The module quiz is either a set of questions on the week's material, or a self-assessed design problem.
- A module wrap up.
