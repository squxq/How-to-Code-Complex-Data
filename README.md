# How to Code: Complex Data - Code and Comprehensive Notes

## A code repository and study notes for the UBCx Software Development MicroMasters course: How to Code - Complex Data

Welcome to this repository, a treasure trove featuring meticulously documented code files and in-depth study notes, handpicked to perfectly capture the content taught in How to Code: Complex Data. This collection stands as a testament to my successful completion of this course, showcasing the progression from fundamental techniques covered in How to Code: Simple Data to the sophisticated nuances of complex data and control structures. This repository is not just a compilation of knowledge but a living proof of dedication and accomplishment.

## Installation

1. **Download Racket:**
If you haven't installed Racket yet, download and install it from the [official Racket website](https://download.racket-lang.org/).
2. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - If you have Git installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data.git
     ```
   - If you don't have Git installed:
     - Click on the "Code" button above, and then select "Download ZIP."
     - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Folder:**
   Change your directory to the location of the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd How-to-Code-Complex-Data
   ```

## Usage

The **NOTES.md** files at the root of this repository and of each module folder include notes, code snippets, links to relevant resources, images and diagrams, and much more. The [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) file at the root of this repository consolidates the notes from all modules and the final project. The **NOTES.md** file for each module contains the comprehensive notes for the entire module, including content from lectures, problem sets and any additional resources. 
The [modules](./modules) folder contains separate subfolders for each module, ranging from [week-07](./modules/week-07) to [enter link description here](./modules/week-12) and, as introduction, [week-00](./modules/week-00). Within each week's folder you'll find: NOTES.md and subfolders corresponding to different sections within the module. Each section folder may contain images, lecture problem files (named "problem-..."), and problem set files with distinct names.
The [final-project](./final-project) folder encompasses the code files for the final project, divided into two parts.
Almost every racket file in the repository has two versions: **"filename.rkt"** and **"filename.no-image.rkt"**, because DrRacket (the IDE installed together with Racket) allows for having images in the code, and with that comes files that have images are not readable outside DrRacket. All those files were adapted, so their images were removed so that they are readable in any IDE, either online or locally.
