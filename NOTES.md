# 0: Introduction

## Syllabus

The complete How to Code course consists of 2 parts. Each part is 6 
weeks long, and each week consists of 1 or 2 modules. All of those 
modules have a similar structure, comprised of:

- An overview describing the module learning goals and summarizing the work required to complete the module.
- A number of blended topic lectures, consisting of video interspersed with questions for you to answer.
- A set of problems that will let you practice the new design techniques before the quiz.
- A module quiz. The module quiz is either a set of questions on the week's material, or a self-assessed design problem.
- A module wrap up.

## Grading

$$
Lecture Questions (25\%) + Quizzes (25\%) + Final Project (50\%) = Final Grade (100\%)
$$

# 7: Mutual Reference

## Module Overview

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify problem domain information of arbitrary size that should be represented using arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes to design with arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes with mutually-referential data.
- Be able to predict and identify the correspondence between
external-, self- and mutual-reference in a data definition and calls,
recursion and mutual-recursion in functions that operate on the data.

## Mutually Recursive Data

[mutuallyRecursiveData.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/mutuallyRecursiveData/mutuallyRecursiveData.rkt)

[mutuallyRecursiveData.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/mutuallyRecursiveData/mutuallyRecursiveData.png)

We are going to look at another form of data called an arbitrary arity tree. This data form is characterized by two cycles in the type comments. Computer scientists draw trees upside down.

We need to develop one or more data definitions that help us represent an information structure like a directory structure. A single integer is all each file holds. This is an arbitrary arity tree:

![Mutually Recursive Data](./modules/week-07/mutuallyRecursiveData/mutuallyRecursiveData.png)

Each element of this tree, or this model of an arbitrary arity tree, can have sub-elements. “mooc” has a subfolder; “current” has a number of subfolders; “starters” has a number of subfolders; but “aisle-starter” just has data.

Why is it called arbitrary arity? Unlike lists, which were arbitrarily long or wide in one dimension. This arbitrary arity tree is arbitrarily sized in two dimensions: arbitrarily wide and arbitrarily deep. Arbitrary means unknown.

In order to deal with this arbitrary-sized in two dimensions structure that this has the key thing that we’re about to see is that it’s going to require two cycles in the type reference graph.

```racket
(define-struct elt (name data subs))
;; Element is (make-elt String Integer ListOfElement)
;; interp. An element in the file system, with name, and EITHER data or subs.
;;         If data is 0, then subs is considered to be list of sub elements.
;;         If data is not 0, then subs is ignored.

;; ListOfElement is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Element ListOfElement)
;; interp. A list of file system Elements

;; Examples: <Element>
(define F1 (make-elt "F1" 1 empty))
(define F2 (make-elt "F2" 2 empty))
(define F3 (make-elt "F3" 3 empty))

;; Examples: <ListOfElement>
(define D4 (make-elt "D4" 0 (list F1 F2)))
(define D5 (make-elt "D5" 0 (list F3)))
(define D6 (make-elt "D6" 0 (list D4 D5)))
```

“ListOfElement” has a self-reference in it - that’s what allows a directory’s list of sub-elements to be arbitrarily long. In addition to that self-reference, there is a reference in the middle of “ListOfElement” back to the “Element” type. There is also a reference from the “Element” type down to “ListOfElement”. Those two references together form what’s called a mutual reference.

The self-reference cycle allows each element to have an arbitrary amount of sub-elements, that is, allows the tree to have arbitrary breadth. The mutual reference cycle allows the tree to have arbitrary depth.

## Templating Mutual Recursion

[templatingMutualRecursion.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/templatingMutualRecursion/templatingMutualRecursion.rkt)

When dealing with types involving mutual reference, group types comments and interpretations, examples and templates. That will help see the mutual recursion structure in the templates corresponding to the mutual reference structure in the types.

Where there is a self-reference there is a natural recursion. Where there is a mutual reference cycle there is a natural mutual recursion.

```racket
;; Note:
; When dealing with types involding mutual reference, group types commments and interpretations,
; examples and templates together.
;; End of Note.

;; Template: <Element>
(define (fn-for-element e)
  (... (elt-name e)                ; String
       (elt-date e)                ; Integer
       (fn-for-loe (elt-subs e)))) ; ListOfElement

;; Template rules used: <Element>
;; - compound: 3 fields
;; - reference: (elt-subs e) is ListOfElement

;; Template: <ListOfElement>
(define (fn-for-loe loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) (...)]
        [else
         (... (fn-for-element (first loe))
              (fn-for-loe (rest loe)))]))

;; Template rules used: <ListOfElement>
;; - one of: 2 cases
;; - atomic distinct: empty
;; - compound: (cons Element ListOfElement)
;; - reference: (first loe) is Element
;; - self-reference: (rest loe) is ListOfElement

;; Note:
; Only use fn-for-something when there is a reference to another data type.
;; End  of Note.
```

## Functions on Mutually Recursive Data - Part 1

[functionsMutuallyRecursiveData.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/functionsMutuallyRecursiveData-01/functionsMutuallyRecursiveData.no-image.rkt)

> Design a function that consumes Element and produces the sum of all the file data in
the tree.
> 

With mutual recursion: do all the functions together.

```racket
;; Signature: <Element>
;; Element -> Integer

;; Signature: <ListOfElement>
;; ListOfElement -> Integer???
```

“???” means we’re not sure of the output of “fn-for-loe” - we will come back to it later.

```racket
;; Stub: <Element>
(define (sum-data--element e) 0)

;; Stub: <ListOfElement>
(define (sum-data--loe loe) 0)
```

We use function names ending in “—element” and “—loe” to have unique names for both functions. Both functions are named “sum-data” because they’re mutually recursive and require each other to work together correctly.

```racket
;; Tests: <Element>
(check-expect (sum-data--element F1) 1)
(check-expect (sum-data--element D5) 3)
(check-expect (sum-data--element D4) (+ 1 2))
(check-expect (sum-data--element D6) (+ 1 2 3))

;; Tests: <ListOfElement>
(check-expect (sum-data--loe empty) 0)
```

When coding mutually recursive functions, remember to rename all mutually recursive and self recursive calls.

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Element>
(define (sum-data--element e)
  (if (zero? (elt-data e))
       (sum-data--loe (elt-subs e))
       (elt-data e)))

;; Template: <used template from ListOfElement>
(define (sum-data--loe loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) 0]
        [else
         (+ (sum-data--element (first loe))
              (sum-data--loe (rest loe)))]))
```

For mutually recursive functions, it’s usually the case that all the functions produce the same type of data. But there are some exceptions of that rule.

The way method works by being data-driven, in terms of getting well-formed, self and mutually referential type comments, to the templates, coding those to complete the functions, and trusting the natural recursions.

The key point is that when I design functions operating on mutually referential types, I don’t design a single function, but one for each type. And so it pays to group the signatures together, to write a single purpose, to group the examples and then group the functions.

### Question 3: Image Organizer

> Complete the design of a hierarchical image organizer.  The information and data
for this problem are similar to the file system example in the fs-starter.rkt file.
But there are some key differences:
> 
> - this data is designed to keep a hierchical collection of images
> - in this data a directory keeps its sub-directories in a separate list from
> the images it contains
> - as a consequence data and images are two clearly separate types
> 
> Start by carefully reviewing the partial data definitions below.
> 

```racket
(define-struct dir (name sub-dirs images))
;; Dir is (make-dir String ListOfDir ListOfImage)
;; interp. An directory in the organizer, with a name, a list
;;         of sub-dirs and a list of images.

;; ListOfDir is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Dir ListOfDir)
;; interp. A list of directories, this represents the sub-directories of
;;         a directory.

;; ListOfImage is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Image ListOfImage)
;; interp. a list of images, this represents the sub-images of a directory.
;; NOTE: Image is a primitive type, but ListOfImage is not.

;; Examples: <Image>
(define I1 (square 10 "solid" "red"))
(define I2 (square 10 "solid" "green"))
(define I3 (rectangle 13 14 "solid" "blue"))

;; Examples: <Dir && ListOfDir>

## Backtracking Search

[backtrackingSearch.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/backtrackingSearch/backtrackingSearch.no-image.rkt)

[backtrackingSearch.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/backtrackingSearch/backtrackingSearch.png)

Searching an arbitrary-arity tree for the first element to have a given property leads to a backtracking traversal of the tree.

> Design a function that consumes String and Element and looks for a data element with the given name. If it finds that element it produces the data, otherwise it produces false.
> 

```racket
;; String Element -> Integer or false
```

What is happening here is this function is going to go look for an element with the given name. Sometimes it’s going to produce the data, otherwise, it’s going to produce false. We have written functions that say whether the “String” is in a “ListOfString”, but that function always produces a “Boolean”. In this case, we need an extension to how we write function signatures to do this.

In some programming languages - in most recent programming languages - there is a more sophisticated mechanism called exceptions for dealing with this kind of case.

```racket
;; String Element -> Integer or false
;; String ListOfElement -> Integer or false???
;; search the given tree for an element for an element with the given name, produce data if found; false otherwise

;; Stubs:
#;
(define (find--element n e) false)
#;
(define (find--loe n loe) false)
```

Now for the tests, ordered more in terms of their complexity:

```racket
;; Tests: <ListOfElement>
(check-expect (find--loe "F3" empty) false)
(check-expect (find--loe "F2" (list F1 F2)) 2)
(check-expect (find--loe "F3" (list F1 F2)) false)

;; Tests: <Element>
(check-expect (find--element "F3" F1) false)
(check-expect (find--element "F3" F3) 3)
(check-expect (find--element "F3" D4) false)
(check-expect (find--element "F1" D4) 1)
(check-expect (find--element "F2" D4) 2)
(check-expect (find--element "D4" D4) 0)
(check-expect (find--element "F3" D6) 3)
(check-expect (find--element "D6" D6) 0)
(check-expect (find--element "F1" D6) 1)
(check-expect (find--element "F3" D6) 3)
```

```racket
;; Template: <Element>
(define (find--element n e)
  (if (string=? n (elt-name e))
       (elt-data e)
       (find--loe n (elt-subs e))))

;; Template: <ListOfElement>
(define (find--loe n loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) false]
        [else
         (... (find--element n (first loe))
              (find--loe n (rest loe)))]))
```

In “find—loe” what are these two natural mutual recursions going to do? They will produce integer or false depending on whether its found in “(first loe)”.

```racket
;; Template: <ListOfElement>
(define (find--loe n loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) false]
        [else
         (if (not (false? (find--element n (first loe))))
              (find--element n (first loe))  ;; produce Integer or false if n is found in (first loe)
              (find--loe n (rest loe)))]))   ;; produce Integer or false if n is found in (rest loe)
```

Finding the same thing twice is a performance problem. Once we learn local expressions we will fix it. The reason we use “not false?” instead of “integer?” is because it is more general for backtracking functions.

Why is this called backtracking? What happens when we look in D6 for F3?

![Backtracking Search](./modules/week-07/backtrackingSearch/backtrackingSearch.png)

Each time we get to a failing node with no sub-elements - those are called leaves because they have no branches anymore - we back up to its parent and then try the next child, the next sub, that’s called backtracking.

### Question 6: Render Arbitrary Arity Tree

[problem-01.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-07/modules/week-07/backtrackingSearch/problem-01.rkt)

> Design a function that consumes Element and produces a rendering of the tree. For example:

(render-tree D6) should produce something like the following.
(open image file)

HINTS:
  - This function is not very different than the first two functions above.
  - Keep it simple! Start with a not very fancy rendering like the one above.
    Once that works you can make it more elaborate if you want to.
  - And... be sure to USE the recipe. Not just follow it, but let it help you.
    For example, work out a number of examples BEFORE you try to code the function.

# 8a: Two One-of Types

## Module Overview

Learning Goals:

- Be able to produce the cross-product of type templates table for a function operating on two values with one-of types.
- Be able to use the table to generate examples and a template.
- Be able to use the table to simplify the function when there are equal answers in some cells.

## Cross Product Table

[crossProductTable.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08a/modules/week-08a/crossProductTable/crossProductTable.no-image.rkt)

[crossProductTable.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08a/modules/week-08a/crossProductTable/crossProductTable.png)

We can use the type comments to reason about the actual behavior of a function. We’re going to take one more step towards designing a function based on a model of the function. A model is a more abstract representation of the function or a less detailed representation of the function.

> Design a function that consumes two lists of strings and produces true
if the first list is a prefix of the second. Prefix means that the elements of
the first list match the elements of the second list 1 for 1, and the second list
is at least as long as the first.
> 
> 
> For reference, the ListOfString data definition is provided below.
> 

```racket
;; =================
;; Data Definitions:

;; ListOfString is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons String ListOfString)
;; interp. a list of strings

;; Examples: <ListOfString>
(define LS0 empty)
(define LS1 (cons "a" empty))
(define LS2 (cons "a" (cons "b" empty)))
(define LS3 (cons "c" (cons "b" (cons "a" empty))))

;; Template: <ListOfString>
#;
(define (fn-for-los los)
  (cond [(empty? los) (...)]
        [else 
         (... (first los)
              (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))

;; ==========
;; Functions:

;; ListOfString ListOfString -> Boolean
;; produce true if lsta is a prefix of lstb

;; Stub:
(define (prefix=? lsta lstb) false)
```

Both of “lsta” and “lstb” are “ListOfString” and both of them have two cases in their “one-of”s. We create a table that has two rows and two columns, which is called a cross product type comments table. The cases of the “one-of” type comments go along the axes.

I can use this design approach even if the two types are not the same: the two arguments don’t have to be identical, but both must be “one-of”.

```racket
;; Tests:
(check-expect (prefix=? empty empty) true)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x") empty) false)
(check-expect (prefix=? empty (list "x")) true)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x") (list "x")) true)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x") (list "y")) false)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x" "y") (list "x" "y")) true)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x" "x") (list "x" "y")) false)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x") (list "x" "y")) true)
(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x" "y" "z") (list "x" "y")) false)
```

## Cross Product Code

[crossProductCode.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08a/modules/week-08a/crossProductCode/crossProductCode.no-image.rkt)

[crossProductCode.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08a/modules/week-08a/crossProductCode/crossProductCode.png)

If we go back and look at the table, it tells us there are four cases: both lists are empty; “lsta” is empty but “lstb” is not; “lstb” is empty but “lsta” is not; both lists are not empty.

```racket
;; Template: <ListOfString ListOfString>
(define (prefix=? lsta lstb)
  (cond [(and (empty? lsta) (empty? lstb)) (...)]
        [(and (cons? lsta) (empty? lstb)) (... (first lsta)
                                               (fn-for-los (rest lsta)))]
        [(and (cons? lstb) (empty? lsta)) (... (first lstb)
                                               (fn-for-los (rest lstb)))]
        [(and (cons? lsta) (cons? lstb)) (... (first lsta) (first lstb)
                                              (fn-for-los (rest lsta))
                                              (fn-for-los (rest lstb)))]))
```

![Cross Product Code](./modules/week-08a/crossProductCode/crossProductCode.png)

```racket
(define (prefix=? lsta lstb)
  (cond [(empty? lsta) (...)]
        [(empty? lstb) (...)]
        [else (... (first lsta) (first lstb)
                   (fn-for-los (rest lsta))
                   (fn-for-los (rest lstb)))]))

(define (prefix=? lsta lstb)
  (cond [(empty? lsta) true]
        [(empty? lstb) false]
        [else (if (string=? (first lsta) (first lstb))
                   (prefix=? (rest lsta) (rest lstb))
                   false)]))
```

The templating step no longer completely precedes the coding step, rather, they are intertwined. Also, we have simplified the template with the cross-product table.

The type comments predict the templates. In other words, they are a model of the functions operating on that type - a non-code representation of that type - and a non-code representation of the program that tells us about what the function will look like.

By using a cross product of type comments table, we are simplifying at a model level.

# 8b: Local

## Module Overview

One of the things that separates good programmers from the other kind is taking the time to improve the structure of their code once it is written.

Learning Goals:

- Be able to write well-formed local expressions.
- Be able to diagram lexical scoping on top of expressions using local.
- Be able to hand-evaluate local expressions.
- Be able to use local to encapsulate function definitions.
- Be able to use local to avoid redundant computation.

## Introduction

We will learn a new language construct called a local expression. Local expressions let us have definitions, functions, and constants that are only available within one small part of the program. Then we will look at two important ways to use “local”. One has to do with organizing programs that are large or written by more than one person. Another has to do with dealing with important performance problems that come up when we can’t use local.

## Forming and Intuition

[forming%26Intuition.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/forming%26Intuition/forming%26Intuition.rkt)

Here’s an example of using “local”:

```racket
(local [(define a 1)
        (define b 2)]
  (+ a b))
;; outputs 3
```

Intuitively, for now, the “local” has two parts. It has the definitions and the body. Local definitions exist only inside the local expression; they do not exist outside of it.

Here it is a “local” in which one of the locally defined definitions is a local constant, and the other a function. We can define a “define-struct” aswell.

```racket
(local [(define p "accio")
        (define (fetch n) (string-append p " " n))]
  (fetch "portkey"))
;; outputs "accio portkey"
```

It’s similar, but very different, than this:

```racket
(define p "accio")
(define (fetch n) (string-append p " " n))
(fetch "portkey")
;; ouputs "accio portkey"
```

It’s different in important ways. The previous definitions are called top-level definitions. They are not inside of “local”. The definitions inside “local” are only valid inside “local”

```racket
a
;; outputs a: this variable is not defined
```

This happens because “a” is a local definition, which exists only inside the “local” expression, not outside of it. Local is an expression. To form a local expression:

$$
(local[<definition>...]\\
<expression>)\\
(local[(define\ p "accio")\\
(define\ (fetch\ n)\ (string-append\ p\ "\ "\ n))]\\
(fetch\ "portkey"))
$$

The intuitive way of understanding the local is that it sets up the definitions, it sets up a special world that has these definitions, and the evaluates the body and produces the result.

## Lexical Scoping

[lexicalScoping.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/lexicalScoping/lexicalScoping.rkt)

We have already seen that “local” lets you have definitions that are available inside the “local”. But what does that mean exactly? Are they available outside? What if there’s a definition outside the “local”, and inside “local” that has the same name? What if there is a “local” inside a “local”?

```racket
(define p "incendio")

(local [(define p "accio")
        (define (fetch n) (string-append p " " n))]
  (fetch "portkey"))
;; outputs "accio portkey"
```

Why is the output: “accio portkey”? 

In a program there is a thing called the top-level scope, the global scope. The way to think about that is that there’s a box around the whole program, and every definition in that box is recorded in the box. There is a “p” definition in the top-level scope. Whenever we encounter a “local”, we make another box just around the “local”. This inner box has a definition for “p” and a another for “fetch”.

What do we do whenever we see a reference to a constant or a function? We start right at the reference and go to the innermost enclosing box - a scope contour. We then see if that innermost enclosing scope contour has a definition for that reference. If it doesn’t we go to the nearest enclosing box until we arrive at the global scope.

```racket
(define a 1)
(define b 2)

(+ a
   (local [(define b 3)]
     (+ a b))
   b)
;; outputs 7
```

## Evaluation Rules

[evaluationRules.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/evaluationRules/evaluationRules.rkt)

“local” is an expression, so it doesn’t affect the evaluation of expressions outside of it, like any other expression.

```racket
(define b 1)

(+ b
   (local [(define b 2)]
     (* b b))
   b)
;; outputs 6
```

The first evaluation step is that the first “b” in the primitive call “+” gets replaced by: 1.

The way “local” evaluation works is that three things are going to happen in one step: 

1. Renaming
2. Lifting
3. Replace entire “local” with renamed body

Renaming: rename definitions and all references to definitions, in which the new name must be globally unique. Technically the “renaming” step works in a more subtle way, but this explanation is good enough to understand the evaluation.

Lifting: lift renamed definitions out of the local, into the -top-level scope (not just out of the expression).

The rules for evaluating “local” expressions work to eliminate the “local” from the program, leaving behind a program we already know how to evaluate.

```racket
;; 1st step:
(+ 1
   (local [(define b 2)]
     (* b b))
   b)

;; 2nd step:
(+ 1
   (local [(define b_0 2)]
     (* b_0 b_0))
   b)

;; 3rd step:
(define b_0 2)
(+ 1
   (local []
     (* b_0 b_0))
   b)

;; 4th step:
(+ 1
   (* b_0 b_0)
   b)

;; 5th step:
(+ 1
   (* 2 b_0)
   b)

;; 6th step:
(+ 1
   (* 2 2)
   b)

;; 7th step:
(+ 1
   4
   b)

;; 8th step
(+ 1
   4
   1)

;; 9th step
6
```

Evaluating rules for local expressions:

- rename all definitions and references to those definitions;
- lift renamed definitions to top-level (global scope);
- replace entire local expression with its body, with references renamed.

## Encapsulation

[encapsulation.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/encapsulation/encapsulation.no-image.rkt)

Encapsulation is one of the most fundamental concepts in software engineering. Imagine a large software system with 10, 20, 50, or 100 programmers on it. How likely is it in that situation that two programmers are going to want to use the same function name for two completely different functions? It’s almost guaranteed to happen. That’s the problem encapsulation solves.

Encapsulation lets us take each part of our program and make it into a capsule - a little package that has a bunch of internal functions and constants and structures, and only a small number of external functions and constants and structures.

```racket
(local [(define a 1)
        (define b 2)]
  (+ a b))
;; outputs 3
```

What encapsulation rests on is the observation that “a” and “b” in this example don’t exist in the global scope.

For example, we can replace this code - from functions on mutually recursive data:

```racket
;; Element -> Integer
;; ListOfElement -> Integer
;; produce the sum of all the data in element (and its subs)

;; Stubs:
;(define (sum-data--element e) 0)
;(define (sum-data--loe loe) 0)

;; Tests: <Element>
(check-expect (sum-data--element F1) 1)
(check-expect (sum-data--element D5) 3)
(check-expect (sum-data--element D4) (+ 1 2))
(check-expect (sum-data--element D6) (+ 1 2 3))

;; Tests: <ListOfElement>
(check-expect (sum-data--loe empty) 0)

;; Template: <used template from Element>
(define (sum-data--element e)
  (if (zero? (elt-data e))
       (sum-data--loe (elt-subs e))
       (elt-data e)))

;; Template: <used template from ListOfElement>
(define (sum-data--loe loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) 0]
        [else
         (+ (sum-data--element (first loe))
              (sum-data--loe (rest loe)))]))
```

With:

```racket
;; Element -> Integer
;; produce the sum of all the data in element (and its subs)

;; Stub:
;(define (sum-data e) 0)

;; Tests: 
(check-expect (sum-data F1) 1)
(check-expect (sum-data D5) 3)
(check-expect (sum-data D4) (+ 1 2))
(check-expect (sum-data D6) (+ 1 2 3))

(define (sum-data e)
  (local [
          (define (sum-data--element e)
            (if (zero? (elt-data e))
                (sum-data--loe (elt-subs e))
                (elt-data e))) 

          (define (sum-data--loe loe)
            (cond [(empty? loe) 0]
                  [else
                   (+ (sum-data--element (first loe))
                      (sum-data--loe (rest loe)))]))]
    (sum-data--element e)))
```

These functions are encapsulated, wrapped in the “local”, so they cannot be seen or called at the top level. At top-level, only sum-data can be called. Since “sum-data” contains the “local” with the definitions for “sum-data—element” and “sum-data—loe”, it encapsulates them. Because of that:

- I only keep the signature of the top-level function;
- I only keep the tests of the top-level function.

In the encapsulation mechanism provided by industrial strength languages, I would still be able to write unit tests for encapsulated functions.

Sometimes we call this line: (sum-data--element e) a trampoline. Because we come to the top of “sum-data”, and bounce off the trampoline into the mutually recursive functions.

To do the encapsulation of some functions:

First thing is to identify some functions that are a good candidate for encapsulation. What makes functions a good candidate for encapsulation is that there are two or more functions that “work together” and the rest of the program only wants to call one function.

Good candidates for encapsulation:

- One function has one or more helpers closely linked to it.
- The outside program really only wants to call the main function, not the helpers.

Then I start by defining the function I want to be seen on the top-level. After that, I start the “local” expression with (”local” and open the definitions part with “[”). I also close the “]”. I, then, write the trampoline calling the appropriate function in the local with the argument passed to the outer function.

The way that this process is so methodical follows the notion of refactoring. Refactoring: changing a program’s code/structure without changing the program’s behavior. Sometimes it is of interest to do a refactoring and then change the behavior, but doing both at the same time should be avoided.

```racket

;; Stubs:

;; Tests:

  (if (string=? (elt-name e) n)
      (elt-data e) 
      (find--loe n (elt-subs e))))

(define (find--loe n loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) false]
        [else
         (if (not (false? (find--element n (first loe)))) 
             (find--element n (first loe))
             (find--loe n (rest loe)))]))
```

```racket
;; String Element -> Integer or false 
;; search the given tree for an element with the given name, produce data if found; false otherwise

;; Stub:
;(define (find n e) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (find "F3" F1) false)

(check-expect (find "D4" D4) 0)
(check-expect (find "D6" D6) 0)
(check-expect (find "F3" D4) false)
(check-expect (find "F1" D4) 1)
(check-expect (find "F2" D4) 2)
(check-expect (find "F1" D6) 1)
(check-expect (find "F3" D6) 3)

(define (find n e)
  (local [
          (define (find--element n e)
            (if (string=? (elt-name e) n)
                (elt-data e) 
                (find--loe n (elt-subs e))))

          (define (find--loe n loe)
            (cond [(empty? loe) false]
                  [else
                   (if (not (false? (find--element n (first loe)))) 
                       (find--element n (first loe))
                       (find--loe n (rest loe)))]))]
    (find--element n e)))
```

Steps to encapsulation:

1. Group all functions to encapsulate together;
2. Open definition with the new global function name and necessary parameters;
3. Open “local” expression and then the definition part of the “local” with “[” right before the original function definitions;
4. Close the definition part of the “local” with “]” after the original function definitions;
5. Add the trampoline call the right function defined in the “local”;
6. Delete unnecessary signatures, tests and stubs;
7. Rename tests and possibly stubs.

For functions operating on mutually referential types, there are always going to be multiple functions, and they are always going to be together. Maybe I should pre-encapsulate the templates.

```racket
;; Template:
#;
(define (fn-for-element e)
  (local [
          (define (fn-for-element e)
            (... (elt-name e)    ;String
                 (elt-data e)    ;Integer
                 (fn-for-loe (elt-subs e))))

          (define (fn-for-loe loe)
            (cond [(empty? loe) (...)]
                  [else
                   (... (fn-for-element (first loe))
                        (fn-for-loe (rest loe)))]))]
    (fn-for-element e)))
```

There is no need to do a base case unit test.

Encapsulation is vital when multiple programmers work on huge programs since it allows them to choose whatever names they want locally. This allows the programmers to do what’s called namespace management.

When requiring “2htdp/image”, I’m requiring the encapsulation mechanism built into Racket. The “2htdp/image” and “2htdp/universe” libraries contain a lot more functions than we need to make the functions we need to work. When we grab a module of code, there are far more unpublished or hidden names than published names. “local” allows us to support encapsulation.

> Encapsulation doesn't just work with mutually recursive functions.
As a guideline, it is valuable whenever one function is useful at top-level,
and it has one or more helpers that are not useful at top level.
With that in mind, let's look at using encapsulation with a sorting example similar
to what you saw in the arrange-images problem from the Function Composition lecture.

## Avoiding Recomputation

[avoidingRecomputation.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/avoidingRecomputation/avoidingRecomputation.no-image.rkt)

[avoidingRecomputation.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-08b/modules/week-08b/avoidingRecomputation/avoidingRecomputation.png)

It is very easy for programmers to worry too much about efficiency, too soon about efficiency, or to worry just plain incorrectly about efficiency. As a general rule, it’s a better idea to design a simple program that’s easy to understand and easy to change and worry about efficiency later, once the program is running. Some of the things I thought would be performance problems get taken care of automatically by the programming language implementation, but others turn out not to be. And then, unfortunately, some other things that I didn’t think would be performance problems turn out to be.

There is one category of performance problems I need to fix as part of the design. That has to do with problems of exponential growth in the time it takes my program or to run as the data gets larger.

```racket
;; Data definitions:

(define-struct elt (name data subs))
;; Element is (make-elt String Integer ListOfElement)

“time” evaluates its operands and returns the time it took to evaluate them. “time” output:

Here, we can see that as the tree gets deeper and deeper it takes twice as long to run.

![Avoiding Recomputation](./modules/week-08b/avoidingRecomputation/avoidingRecomputation.png)

The problem this program has is in a branch where it finds the value it’s looking for, it searches in that branch twice.

We need to use “local” to avoid recomputing the same value twice. Here is the systematic way to do it:

1. find nearest enclosing expression containing the multiple computations;
2. wrap the nearest enclosing expression in “local”;
3. define the result of the computation in the local definitions; we call it “try” because we’re trying to search down that branch of the tree;
4. replace the computation with the name it is given in the “local”;
5. close the “local”.

Result:

```racket
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0
1
```

What this does: look in the first child once and define that result as “try”. So when it is referenced later, we don’t compute it again, we just take the value from “try”.

Using “local” to avoid recomputation was “worth it” here because exponential growth is very bad when it comes to computation time. We had exponential growth because of the recursive nature of the function.

Here is something not encouraged to do: if a function takes an argument that it consumes and adds one to it, twice, using “local” to avoid the computation of adding one twice isn’t worth doing. That’s going to make the program harder to read for no performance gain at all. Programming language implementations are good at spotting things like that and doing them automatically.

You will assess your solution to the design quiz according to the following rubric:

1. Is the program "commit-ready"?The file should be neat and tidy, no tests or code should be commented out other than stubs and templates, and all scratch work should be removed.
2. Is the design complete? All design elements should be present, including those from HtDF, as well as a cross-product table, and each element should be well-formed.
3. Does the design have high internal quality? All HtDF elements should have high internal quality; the signature should be correct, the purpose should be clear and succinct, the function body should be clear. At a bare minimum, there should be as many tests as cells in the cross-product table, and these tests should be correct and should pass when the program is run. The cross-product table should be simplified, and the structure of the function should match the structure of the cross product table.
4. Does the design satisfy the problem requirements? The design solutions should satisfy the problem statements. If there is any ambiguity in the problem statements the solution should identify and resolve that ambiguity.

# 9: Abstraction

## Module Overview

One of the things that separates good programmers from the other kind is taking the time to improve the structure of their code once it is written. This module covers abstraction, which is a technique for taking highly repetitive code and refactoring out the identical parts to leave behind a shared helper and just the different parts of the original code. The shared helper is called an abstract function because it is more general, or less detailed, than the original code.

Abstraction is a crucial technique for managing complexity in programs. One aspect of this is that it can make programs smaller if the abstract functions are used by many other functions in the system. Another aspect is that it helps separate knowledge domains more clearly in code.

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify 2 or more functions that are candidates for abstraction.
- Be able to design an abstract function starting with 2 or more highly repetitive functions (or expressions).
- Be able to design an abstract fold function from a template.
- Be able to write signatures for abstract functions.
- Be able to write signatures that use type parameters.
- Be able to identify a function which would benefit from using a built-in abstract function
- Be able to use built-in abstract functions

## From Examples 1

[fromExamples1.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/fromExamples1/fromExamples1.rkt)

If we have two expressions, that vary only in the position of some value (point of variance) - two highly repetitive expressions - we could take one of the expressions and wrap a function definition around it (in which the parameter stands for the varying value). 

```racket
(* pi (sqr 4)) ; area of circle radius 4
(* pi (sqr 6)) ; area of circle radius 6

(define (area r)
  (* pi (sqr r)))

(area 4) ; area of circle radius 4
(area 6) ; area of circle radius 6
```

Steps:

1. Identify two highly repetitive expressions;
2. Introduce a new function:
- around one copy of repetitive code;
- with a more general name;
- add a parameter for varying position;
- use parameter in varying position.
3. Replace specific expressions:
- with calls to abstract function;
- pass varying value.

This function is more abstract than the specific expressions because it is more general than the specific expressions.

We can do the same thing in these two functions, which only differ in the value they are looking for:

```racket
;; ListOfString -> Boolean
;; produce true if los includes "UBC"

;; Stub:
;(define (contains-ubc? los) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (contains-ubc? empty) false)
(check-expect (contains-ubc? (cons "McGill" empty)) false)
(check-expect (contains-ubc? (cons "UBC" empty)) true)
(check-expect (contains-ubc? (cons "McGill" (cons "UBC" empty))) true)

;; Template: <used template from ListOfString>

(define (contains-ubc? los)
  (cond [(empty? los) false]
        [else
         (if (string=? (first los) "UBC")
             true
             (contains-ubc? (rest los)))]))

;; ListOfString -> Boolean
;; produce true if los includes "McGill"

;; Stubs:
;(define (contains-mcgill? los) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (contains-mcgill? empty) false)
(check-expect (contains-mcgill? (cons "UBC" empty)) false)
(check-expect (contains-mcgill? (cons "McGill" empty)) true)
(check-expect (contains-mcgill? (cons "UBC" (cons "McGill" empty))) true)

;; Template: <used template from ListOfString>

(define (contains-mcgill? los)
  (cond [(empty? los) false]
        [else
         (if (string=? (first los) "McGill")
             true
             (contains-mcgill? (rest los)))]))
```

Which will look like this, after applying the previous steps:

```racket
(define (contains-ubc? los)
  (contains? "UBC" los))

(define (contains-mcgill? los)
  (contains? "McGill" los))

(define (contains? s los)
  (cond [(empty? los) false]
        [else
         (if (string=? (first los) s)
             true
             (contains? s (rest los)))]))
```

This function doesn’t have a signature, a purpose, or even tests. Because we started from working code and worked systematically this way, we ended up with working code. This way of arriving at a working function design is called “abstraction from examples”. We work backward, first is the function definition, then the tests, then the purpose, then the signature.

```racket
;; ListOfNumber -> ListOfNumber
;; produce list of sqr of every number in lon

;; Stub:
;(define (squares lon) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (squares empty) empty)
(check-expect (squares (list 3 4)) (list 9 16))

;; Template: <used template from ListOfNumber>

(define (squares lon)
  (map2 sqr lon))

;; ListOfNumber -> ListOfNumber
;; produce list of sqrt of every number in lon

;; Stub:
;(define (square-roots lon) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (square-roots empty) empty)
(check-expect (square-roots (list 9 16)) (list 3 4))

;; Template: <used template from ListOfNumber>

(define (square-roots lon)
  (map2 sqrt lon))

(define (map2 fn lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) empty]
        [else
         (cons (fn (first lon))
               (map2 fn (rest lon)))]))
```

“map2” is called a higher-order function, so it can: consume one or more functions as its arguments (callback functions); or produce a function. We can achieve something like this in almost every programming language. But there is no other programming language in which the notation for doing it is as simple as it is here.

## From Examples 2

[fromExamples2.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/fromExamples2/fromExamples2.rkt)

Functions can consume other functions as arguments. Letting us do that makes it possible to easily write abstract functions, which allows us to write other functions that are very short, and very simple to write. After writing the function body, we have to write the tests:

```racket
;; Tests:
(check-expect (contains? "UBC" empty) false)
(check-expect (contains? "UBC" (cons "McGill" empty)) false)
(check-expect (contains? "UBC" (cons "UBC" empty)) true)
(check-expect (contains? "UBC" (cons "McGill" (cons "UBC" empty))) true)
(check-expect (contains? "UBC" (cons "UBC" (cons "McGill" empty))) true)
(check-expect (contains? "Toronto" (cons "UBC" (cons "McGill" empty))) false)

(define (contains? s los)
  (cond [(empty? los) false]
        [else
         (if (string=? (first los) s)
             true
             (contains? s (rest los)))]))
```

The recipe lets us do the easiest things first; usually, that’s the signature, but in abstract functions, it’s not. The reason we’re going through the recipe backward is that. paradoxically, as we go back toward the signature each step gets harder and harder with abstract functions.

```racket
;; produce true if the given list of strings, los, includes the also given string, s
```

Here, the signature could be abstracted from the more precise signatures easily, but this is not always the case.

For the previously written function, “map2”:

```racket
;; produce list of sqr or sqrt of every number in the given list, lon ; not a good purpose, since the function is more abstract than this
;; given a function, fn, and a list (list n0 n1 ...), lon, produce (list (fn n0) (fn n1) ...)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (map2 sqr empty) empty)
(check-expect (map2 sqr (list 2 4)) (list 4 16))
(check-expect (map2 sqrt (list 16 9)) (list 4 3))
(check-expect (map2 abs (list 2 -3 4)) (list 2 3 4))
```

```

## From Examples 3

[fromExamples3.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/fromExamples3/fromExamples3.rkt)

The signatures come last because with abstract functions they can sometimes be the hardest thing to do. The way the signatures are done is a bit different than the way they have been done before. I’m going to look at the code and read the signature off of it. Some programming languages do a thing like this automatically, and it’s called type inference. For the “contains?” function:

```racket
(define (contains? s los)
  (cond [(empty? los) false] ; here
        [else
         (if (string=? (first los) s)
             true ; here
             (contains? s (rest los)))]))
```

These are the only places where the function is producing a value. In the false part of the “if statement” it calls itself again. So, true and false are the only outputs. The function, therefore, produces a boolean.

We can also see that the first argument to “contains?”, s, is used as an argument to “string=”. “string=” requires both of its arguments to be strings. Therefore, s has to be a string.

If X is some type (i.e. String, Number, Image, etc):

```racket
; (listof X) is like ListOfX, where:
;; ListOfX is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons X ListOfX)
; except it is not needed the data definition for (listof X)
```

The signature of “contains?”:

```racket
;; String (listof String) -> Boolean
```

For the function “map2”. 

```racket
(define (map2 fn lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) empty]
        [else
         (cons (fn (first lon))
               (map2 fn (rest lon)))]))
```

The first argument, fn, is a function. In the signature of a higher order function, the type of a function parameter is that function’s signature wrapped in parentheses. 

We can also clearly see that the function produces a list. What do we know about the elements of the list? To figure that out, I should look for a place that calls “first” on the list. We can notice that only fn operates on “(first lon)”. “map2” itself never operates on it. The elements of the list, as far as “map2” is concerned, can be anything, but they have to be something that fn is prepared to accept.

We are going to use a type parameter, which, by convention are uppercase, single letters of the alphabet (i.e. X, Y, Z, A, B). “map2”, also, never really operates on what the function produces.

```racket
;; (X -> Y) (listof X) -> (listof Y)
```

The signature of “map2” says: give it a function that consumes X and produces Y. Give it a list of X, and it will give you a list of Y.

> Write a “check-expect” for “map2” using “string-length” as fn.
> 

```racket
(check-expect (map2 string-length (list "ajshdfgasf" "afsdguyoifavewyawegfaesfg" "hsf" "alusdgfauyosgvawueyigfvuaysedf"))
              (list 10 25 3 30))
```

So far, there have been introduced three new pieces of notation:

- The (listof X) type instead of ListOfX;
- When a function is passed as an argument, we write its signature in parentheses in the larger signature;
- Use of type parameters makes sure types are consistent where they need to be (remember: (listof X) just means (listof <some type>)).

For the “filter2” function:

```racket
;; (X -> Boolean) (listof X) -> (listof X)
```

That’s the process of inferring the signature for an abstract function by looking at the code for the abstract function, and, piece by piece, inferring what I can about the types of arguments the abstract function consumes and the type of result the abstract function produces.

> Suppose you needed to design a function to look up an account based on its ID.
Would it be better to design the function using fold-act, or to design the
function using the fn-for-acts template?  Briefly justify your answer.
> 

```racket
;A fold function, also known as a reduce function, is typically used for aggregating values in a collection,
;such as summing up elements or finding the maximum value. It might not be the most suitable choice for a
;simple account lookup, which is more of a search operation rather than an aggregation.
;
;The choice of design template depends on the nature of the operation you're performing. For account
;lookup, data structures tailored for efficient retrieval are likely to be more suitable than fold functions,   
;which are better suited for aggregation operations.
;
;In the context of searching for an account, it is ideal to stop the search as soon as the target directory
;has been found, which is known as short-circuit behavior. Fold functions do not support short-circuiting
;because they process all elements regardless of the intermediate result.
```

## Using Built In Abstract Functions

[builtInAbstractFunctions.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/builtInAbstractFunctions/builtInAbstractFunctions.no-image.rkt)

“map” and “filter” are so useful that they’re built into the intermediate student language. It provides what are called built-in abstract list functions. How do we decide which built-in function is appropriate in a given situation and how do we set ourselves to use it properly?  Examples of the use of abstract functions are down below:

```racket
(check-expect (map positive? (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list true false true false))
; here 'positive?' is the function
(check-expect (filter negative? (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list -2 -4))
; here 'negative?' is the predicate

(check-expect (foldr + 0 (list 1 2 3)) (+ 1 2 3 0))   ; foldr is abstraction
(check-expect (foldr * 1 (list 1 2 3)) (* 1 2 3 1))   ; of sum and product
; here '*' is the conbination and '1' is the base-case result

(check-expect (build-list 6 identity) (list 0 1 2 3 4 5))
; here, the function 'identity' produces its argument, and build-list produces a list of given number - 1
(check-expect (build-list 4 sqr) (list 0 1 4 9))
```

Signatures of some built-in abstract functions:

- build-list: Natural → (listof X)
- filter: (listof X) → (listof X)
- map: (listof X) → (listof Y)
- andmap: (listof X) → Boolean
- ormap: (listof X) → Boolean
- foldr: Y (listof X) → Y
- foldl: Y (listof X) → Y

Note: X and Y don’t have to be different, they just can be different.

> Complete the design of the following functions by coding them using a built-in abstract list function.
> 

```racket
;; (listof Image) -> (listof Image)
;; produce list of only those images that are wide?

;; Stub:
#;
(define (wide-only loi) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (wide-only (list I1 I2 I3 I4 I5)) (list I2 I4))

;; Template:
#;
(define (wide-only loi)
  (filter ... loi))

(define (wide-only loi)
  (filter wide? loi))
```

One of the things that is nice about using built-in abstract functions is that my function definitions get short. They get so short that it might be tempting to write them in one line. That can be called a one-liner. The base case test isn’t needed when using built-in abstract functions, since they are already thoroughly tested.

```racket
;; (listof Image) -> Boolean
;; are all the images in loi tall?

;; Stub:
#;
(define (all-tall? loi) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (all-tall? LOI1) false)

;; Template:
#;
(define (all-tall? loi)
  (andmap ... loi))

(define (all-tall? loi)
  (andmap tall? loi))

;; (listof Number) -> Number
;; sum the elements of a list

;; Stub:
#;
(define (sum lon) 0)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (sum (list 1 2 3 4)) 10)

;; Template:
#;
(define (sum lon)
  (foldr ... ... lon))

(define (sum lon)
  (foldr + 0 lon))
```

Sometimes one built in abstract list function can’t do it all, but we can use function composition to get what we want.

```racket
;; Natural -> Natural
;; produce the sum of the first n natural numbers

;; Stub:
#;
(define (sum-to n) 0)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (sum-to 3) (+ 0 1 2))

;; Template:
#;
(define (sum-to n)
  (foldr ... ... (build-list ... ...)))

(define (sum-to n)
  (foldr + 0 (build-list n identity)))
```

This is a way of saying, let “foldr” do something to a bunch of natural numbers - that’s “build-list”’s role. In fact, lots of languages have something like this. Python has something called “range” which works exactly this way.

## Closures

[closures.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/closures/closures.no-image.rkt)

When the function passed to an abstract function requires access to a parameter of the enclosing function, it must be locally defined. Sometimes the function that we want to pass to an abstract function, the function we’re passing as an argument, doesn’t exist yet. In those cases, it can always be defined locally, if we want. But there is a very interesting subcase where we must define it with local.

```racket
;; (listof Image) -> (listof Image)
;; produce list of only those images that have width >= height

;; Stub:
#;
(define (wide-only loi) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (wide-only (list I1 I2 I3 I4 I5)) (list I2 I4))

;; Template:
#;
(define (wide-only loi) 
  (filter ... loi))

(define (wide-only loi)
  (local [(define (wide? i)
            (> (image-width i) (image-height i)))]
    (filter wide? loi)))
```

When the body of a function we want to pass to an abstract function refers to a parameter of the outer function, then the function we want to pass must be defined using local. It simply cannot be defined at top level.

```racket
;; Number (listof Image) -> (listof Image)
;; produce list of only those images in loi with width >= w

;; Stub:
#;
(define (wider-than-only w loi) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (wider-than-only 40 LOI1) (list I4 I5))

;; Template:
#;
(define (wider-than-only w loi)
  (filter ... loi))

(define (wider-than-only w loi)
  (local [(define (wider-than? i) (> (image-width i) w))]
  (filter wider-than? loi)))
```

Here, notice “w” is not passed to “wider-than?”. “wider-than?” can only take one argument because of how “filter” works. The “w” comes from the enclosing function - it is not defined at top level. Since the local is within the scope of: “(define (wider-than-only w loi) …)”, we can refer to “w” and “loi” there because of lexical scoping, as we have been doing in all function bodies through the course.

“wider-than?” is called a “closure”, because it closes over the surrounding value of “w” passed to “wider-than-only”. Since through the evaluation of local functions will be renamed and lifted, by closing over “w”, we make a special version of “wider-than?” for each value of “w”.

In the first case, “wide?” takes in “i” and refers only to i in its body. There’s nothing special here. But in the second case, “wider-than?” takes in “i” but “w” is in its body as well. So it must be defined where “w” has meaning - in the definition of “wider-than-only”. And to define it within the definition, we need to use a local. This sort of function is called a closure.

## Fold Functions

[foldFunctions.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/foldFunctions/foldFunctions.no-image.rkt)

[foldFunctions.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-09/modules/week-09/foldFunctions/foldFunctions.rkt)

For the information determine the type of comments. Type comments determine the template. The template determines the form of the functions. When we have repetitive functions, we can abstract them into an abstract function. Could there be a way to shorten that route?

```racket
;; At this point in the course, the type (listof X) means:

;; ListOfX is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons X ListOfX)
;; interp. a list of X

;; and the template for (listof X) is:

(define (fn-for-lox lox)
  (cond [(empty? lox) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first lox)
              (fn-for-lox (rest lox)))]))
```

> Design an abstract fold function for (listof X).
> 

A fold function is an abstract function based directly on the template (or templates in the case of mutual reference).

```racket
(define (fold fn b lox)
  (cond [(empty? lox) b] ; base case result
        [else
         (fn (first lox) ; the combination function (combines (first lox) 
              (fn-for-lox (rest lox)))])) ; and the natural recursion on (rest lox))
```

It's a convention to place the function arguments first when designing abstract functions. Can this function only output numbers? Where is its output determined? Is it the type of the elements in the list that determines the type of the output? The function’s output will be the result of the inner function call.

```racket
;; (X Y -> Y) Y (listof X) -> Y
;; the abstract fold function for (listof X)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (fold + 0 (list 1 2 3)) 6)
(check-expect (fold * 1 (list 1 2 3)) 6)
(check-expect (fold string-append "" (list "a" "bc" "def")) "abcdef")
```

“fold” is the abstract function for the (listof X) type, based on its template so most of the functions we’ve made based on this template can be implemented using “fold”.

;The primary issue with the fold-version (or fold-element version) lies in the fact that it continues folding
;even after the target element has been found. This can lead to unnecessary traversals of the tree, which is
;inefficient, especially in the context of large trees.
;
;In the fold-version, the folding functions (c1 and c2) do not have a mechanism to signal that the target element
;has been found and further folding is unnecessary. As a result, the entire tree is traversed even after finding
;the target element, and the folding functions are applied to every element.
;
;On the other hand, in the find-first-version, a recursive approach is used, and as soon as the target element is
;found, the recursion stops, preventing unnecessary traversal.
;
;In summary, the missing aspect in the fold-version is a mechanism to terminate the folding process once the target
;element is found. The find-first-version addresses this by using recursion and returning the result as soon as the  
;target element is located.

> Is fold-dir really the best way to code the function from part C? Why or why not?
> 

```racket
;The fold functions (such as 'foldr' or 'foldl') operate by iterating over a data
;structure and applying a folding function to combine elements in a specific way.
;When it comes to searching for a specific element, like findind a directory with
;the right name, using a fold operation doesn't allow for early termination because
;the fold function processes all elements in the data structure.
;
;In the context of searching for a directory, it is ideal to stop the search as soon
;as the target directory has been found, which is known as short-circuit behavior.
;Fold functions do not support short-circuiting because they process all elements
;regardless of the intermediate result.

# 10a: Generative Recursion

## Module Overview

Generative recursion is in many ways similar to structural recursion: a function calls itself recursively (or several functions call themselves in mutual recursion). Each recursive call must receive an argument that is in some way "closer to the base case"; this is what guarantees the recursion will eventually terminate. In the structural recursion we have already seen, the nature of the data definitions and the template rules provide us the guarantee that we will reach the base case. But in generative recursion, we have to develop that proof for each function we write.

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify whether a recursive function (or a set of
mutually recursive functions) uses structural or generative recursion.
- Be able to formulate a termination argument for a recursive function (or a set of mutually recursive functions).
- Be able to design functions that use generative recursion (algorithms).

## Introduction

The main idea this week is what’s called generative recursion. We have been writing recursive programs already, so what’s the difference between those and these? The ones we have been writing are called structural (or natural) recursion. The way they work is they start with a piece of data, and at each recursive call, they take some sub-piece of that data as the argument to the next recursive call. 

In generative recursion, a different thing happens, which is that at each recursive call, we generate entirely new data to operate on in the recursive call. The other thing is that with generative recursion, we’ve lost the old proof that our recursive functions will end up stopping, that they’ll reach an end.

Fractals are images where the image itself as a recursive structure, some people call them math art.

```racket
;; Number -> Image
;; produce a Sierpinski triangle of the given size, s

;; Stub:
#; (define (stri s) (square 0 "solid" "white"))
```

Always start with the base (or trivial) case. The base case in this function is that we’re asked to produce a triangle that’s so small we’re not going to recurse anymore. Defining that size as a constant lets us easily alter it. 

```racket
(define CUTOFF 2)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (stri CUTOFF)
              (triangle CUTOFF "outline" "red"))
```

Especially in generative recursion, the next smallest case after the base case (or trivial case) can really help us understand how the function works. When there’s recomputation in recursion, things can get very slow, so avoiding recomputation is worth it in those cases.

```racket
(check-expect (stri (* CUTOFF 2))
              (overlay (triangle (* CUTOFF 2) "outline" "red")
                   (local [(define sub (triangle CUTOFF "outline" "red"))]
                     (above sub (beside sub sub)))))
```

The template for generative recursion:

```racket
;; Template:
#;
(define (genrec-fn d)
  (if (trivial? d)
      (trivial-answer d)
      (... d
           (genrec-fn (next-problem d)))))
```

The way to read the if statement is the same thing as saying: are we in the base case? Is the side length smaller than or equal to “CUTOFF”? The reason we call it trivial in this template is this is the problem that’s so simple that we’re not going to have to do any recursion.

```racket
(define (stri s)
  (if (<= s CUTOFF)
      (triangle s "outline" "red")
      (... s
           (stri (next-problem s)))))
```

We’re not making a triangle of size “CUTOFF”. And the reason why because s might be smaller than “CUTOFF”. It’s just at least as small as “CUTOFF”.

```racket
(define (stri s)
  (if (<= s CUTOFF)
      (triangle s "outline" "red")
      (overlay (triangle s "outline" "red")
           (local [(define sub (stri (/ s 2)))]
                     (above sub (beside sub sub))))))
```

In this template for generative recursion, there were three pieces we had to fill in: the trivial predicate, which meant - we’ve reached the end of the recursion - in the terminology we used for natural recursion, this was the base case test; the trivial answer - which is what we do at the end of the recursion - in the terminology we used for structural recursion, this was the base case result; and then we did the non-base case where we do something with the current value “d”.

## Termination Arguments

[terminationArguments.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10a/modules/week-10a/terminationArguments/terminationArguments.no-image.rkt)

[terminationArguments.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10a/modules/week-10a/terminationArguments/terminationArguments.png)

[terminationArguments.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10a/modules/week-10a/terminationArguments/terminationArguments.rkt)

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. ... The sequence of numbers involved is referred to as the hailstone sequence or hailstone numbers (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud).

f(n) = /   n/2       if n is even
          \   3n + 1  if n is odd

(open image file)

The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.

![Termination Arguments](./modules/week-10a/terminationArguments/terminationArguments.png)

```racket
;; Integer[>=1] -> (listof Integer[>=1])
;; produce hailstone sequence for n

;; Tests:
(check-expect (hailstones 1) (list 1))
(check-expect (hailstones 2) (list 2 1))
(check-expect (hailstones 4) (list 4 2 1))
(check-expect (hailstones 5) (list 5 16 8 4 2 1))

(define (hailstones n)
  (if (= n 1) 
      (list 1)
      (cons n 
            (if (even? n)
                (hailstones (/ n 2))
                (hailstones (add1 (* n 3)))))))
```

Using the recipe for generative recursion, we have here a function for “hailstones” - that’s what this sequence is historically called. “hailstones” is a recursive function that calls itself with either “(/ n 2)” or “(add1 (* n 3))”.

The structurally recursive functions we’ve written so far in the course were based off templates for well-formed self-referential types with:

- a base case;
- a self-referential case.

The base case meant we had a case where we would stop. Because even if we weren’t at the base case, the function was talking sub-pieces which would reduce to the base case.

What about these recursive functions? They’re not operating on a well-formed self-referential data definition. That previous proof that they would stop doesn’t apply anymore. What we need for these functions is a three-part termination argument.

Three part termination argument for “stri”:

```racket
;Three part termination argument for stri.
;
;Base case: (<= s CUTOFF)
;
;Reduction step: (/ s 2)
;
;Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
;reach the base case: as long as the CUTOFF is > 0 and s starts >= 0 
;repeated division by 2 will eventually be less than CUTOFF.
```

With this three-part termination argument, which should always be included when generative recursion is used, we know that “stri” will stop.

Three part termination argument for “hailstones”:

```racket
;Three part termination argument for hailstones.
;
;Base case: (= n 1)
;
;Reduction step:
;    if n is even (/ n 2)
;    if n is odd  (+ 1 (* n 3))
;
;Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
;reach the base case: ...
```

Now we need to argue that the repeated application of the reduction step will eventually reach the base case. The first line looks good and keeps getting smaller. But on the next line, “n” gets bigger: it multiplies by 3 and adds 1. This could be hard, and in fact, this is hard. It’s so extremely hard that mathematicians haven’t been able to prove it yet.

This shows the importance of termination arguments. Termination arguments are not always simple. They’re essential because we have generative recursion, we don’t know whether these functions are going to stop without a termination argument, so they’re essential.

# 10b: Search

## Module Overview

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify whether a function should be designed using
domain knowledge, structural recursion, built-in abstract list functions or generative recursion.
- Be able to design a backtracking generative search.

## Lambda Expressions

[lambdaExpressions.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/lambdaExpressions/lambdaExpressions.no-image.rkt)

What is the problem that lambda expressions help us solve. Let’s look at these two functions:

```racket
;; Number (listof Number) -> (listof Number)
;; produce only elements of lon > threshold

;; Tests:
(check-expect (only-bigger 2 empty) empty)
(check-expect (only-bigger 3 (list 2 4 5)) (list 4 5))

(define (only-bigger threshold lon)
  (local [(define (pred n) 
            (> n threshold))]
    
    (filter pred lon)))

;; (listof Image) -> (listof Natural)
;; produce list of areas of images

;; Tests:
(check-expect (all-areas (list (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "blue") 
                               (square 10 "solid" "white")))
              (list 6 100))

(define (all-areas loi)
  (local [(define (area i)
            (* (image-width i)
               (image-height i)))]
    (map area loi)))
```

Both of these function definitions have a local function in them, and that local function is only used in one place inside the larger function. So, not only are these functions which are not used outside - that’s why they are defined with “local” - but they’re also functions which are only used in one place inside the “local”.

They are also quite simple functions, functions where giving them a name doesn’t make the code any clearer. The body is so easily understood (for being small, for example) that naming the function doesn’t make the code easier to understand. What we can do is this:

```racket
(define (only-bigger threshold lon)
    (filter (lambda (n) (> n threshold)) lon))
```

What we have here is what’s called an anonymous function, and we’re calling filter with that anonymous function. So “lambda” is a good thing to use in cases just like this.

```racket
(define (all-areas loi)
  (map (lambda (i)
         (* (image-width i)
            (image-height i))) loi))

;; (listof Number)  ->  (listof Number)
;; produce list of numbers sorted in ASCENDING order
;; ASSUMPTION: lon contains no duplicates

;; Tests:
(check-expect (qsort empty)                empty)
(check-expect (qsort (list 8))             (list 8))
(check-expect (qsort (list 7 8 9))         (list 7 8 9))
(check-expect (qsort (list  4 3 2 1))      (list 1 2 3 4))
(check-expect (qsort (list 6 8 1 9 3 7 2)) (list 1 2 3 6 7 8 9))

#; (define (qsort lon)
     (if (empty? lon) 
         empty
         (local [(define p (first lon))
                 (define (<p? n) (< n p))
                 (define (>p? n) (> n p))]
           (append (qsort (filter <p? lon))
                   (list p) 
                   (qsort (filter >p? lon))))))

(define (qsort lon)
  (if (empty? lon) 
      empty
      (local [(define p (first lon))]
        (append (qsort (filter (λ (n) (< n p)) lon))
                (list p) 
                (qsort (filter (λ (n) (> n p)) lon))))))
```

By clicking: CTRL+\, we can type the λ symbol, in DrRacket, which works the same as “lambda”. The logo from DrRacket project looks like a lambda expression. It’s what they call their “steal your face lambda”. This pays homage to the Grateful Dead’s album “Steal Your Face”. Lambda Calculus is a foundational concept in programming languages that underlies our understanding of programming languages and computation in general.

## Sudoku — Terminology

[sudoku--terminology.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--terminology/sudoku--terminology.png)

Sudoku is played on a nine by nine board, so the board has 81 squares. In addition to the 81 squares, we say that the board has nine rows, nine columns, and nine boxes - three by three blocks of the whole board.

![Sudoku - Terminology](./modules/week-10b/sudoku--terminology/sudoku--terminology.png)

The rows, the columns, and the boxes together comprise what are called, units. There’s 27 total units, because there’s nine rows, nine columns, and nine boxes.

The goal of the game is to fill every square with a natural number from one to nine but making sure that there’s not a duplicate number in any unit.

## Sudoku — Data Definitions and Primitives

[sudoku--dataDefinitions%26primitives.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--dataDefinitions%26primitives/sudoku--dataDefinitions%26primitives.no-image.rkt)

If we’re working systematically, it lets us take advantages of good decisions, and makes it easy to go back and change bad decisions.

Program description:

```racket
;;
;; Brute force Sudoku solver
;;
;; In Sudoku, the board is a 9x9 grid of SQUARES.
;; There are 9 ROWS and 9 COLUMNS, there are also 9
;; 3x3 BOXES.  Rows, columns and boxes are all UNITs.
;; So there are 27 units.
;;
;; The idea of the game is to fill each square with
;; a Natural[1, 9] such that no unit contains a duplicate
;; number.
;;
```

Data Definitions:

```racket
;; =================
;; Data definitions:

;; Val is Natural[1, 9]

;; Board is (listof Val|false)   that is 81 elements long
;; interp.
;;  Visually a board is a 9x9 array of squares, where each square
;;  has a row and column number (r, c).  But we represent it as a
;;  single flat list, in which the rows are layed out one after
;;  another in a linear fashion. (See interp. of Pos below for how
;;  we convert back and forth between (r, c) and position in a board.)

;; Pos is Natural[0, 80]
;; interp.
;;  the position of a square on the board, for a given p, then
;;    - the row    is (quotient p 9)
;;    - the column is (remainder p 9)

;; Convert 0-based row and column to Pos
(define (r-c->pos r c) (+ (* r 9) c))  ;helpful for writing tests

;; Unit is (listof Pos) of length 9
;; interp. 
;;  The position of every square in a unit. There are
;;  27 of these for the 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 boxes.

Note that in the beginning of the file we are requiring: (require racket/list), which gives us: “list-ref”, “take”, and “drop”. We could, also, have coded “read-square” and “fill-square” “from scratch” by using the functions operating on 2 one-of data rule. Function definitions, including “from scratch” versions:

```racket
;; =====================
;; Function Definitions:

;; Produce value at given position on board.

;; Tests:
(check-expect (read-square BD2 (r-c->pos 0 5)) 6)
(check-expect (read-square BD3 (r-c->pos 7 0)) 8)

;; "from scratch":
;; this: (r-c->pos 7 0), returns an index: Natural[0, 80]
;; IMPORTANT: board, bd, is never empty

;Function on 2 complex data: Board and Pos.
;We can assume that p is <= (length bd).
;
;              empty     (cons Val-or-False Board)
; 0             XXX         (first bd)
; 
; (add1 p)      XXX         <natural recursion>

#; (define (read-square bd p)
     (cond [(= p 0) (first bd)]
           [else
            (read-square (rest bd) (- p 1))]))

(define (read-square bd p)
  (list-ref bd p))               

;; Board Pos Val -> Board
;; produce new board with val at given position

## Sudoku — The Search Intuition

[sudoku--searchIntuition.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--searchIntuition/sudoku--searchIntuition.png)

The basic idea that’s going to underlie out Sudoku board solver is - we’re going to take an initial Sudoku board and we’re going to generate a tree of all the possible boards that follow from it, looking for a solution. It’s going to be a generative recursion.

So we want to find a solution to a Sudoku board or maybe find out that the board is not solvable. Well, the idea behind brute force search is: here’s the first empty square; what if I take that square and I fill it in with all possible values. That gives me 9 possible next boards. Of course some of those boards are immediately invalid. So we immediately rule our the invalid boards. Then we just do the same thing again for all the newly generated boards.

What are we doing? We are generating an arbitrary-arity tree and doing a backtracking search over it. The generation is straightforward. The second row of boards are new boards, these aren’t som sub-part of the first board - generative recursion. The reason it is an arbitrary-arity tree is that each board has zero to nine valid children - valid next boards. We’re also doing a backtracking search - along each branch we either:

- come to a board with no valid next boards - produce false.
- come to a full (and valid) board - the solution.

## Sudoku — Template Blending

[sudoku--templateBlending.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--templateBlending/sudoku--templateBlending.no-image.rkt)

We are going to step back a little from the way we’ve talked about templates before. We’re going to relax them a little bit. But the fundamental idea underlying template isn’t going to change at all because what templates have always been from day one is they were the answer to a very simple question: given what I know about what this function consumes, what it produces and what it does - how much do I know about the form of the function before I start on the details?

Our search function produces the solved board (which is what it has been “searching” for) or false if there is none.

```racket
;; Board -> Board|false
;; produces a solution a solution for board, bd; or false if board is unsolvable
;; ASSUME: bd is valid

;; Stub:
#; (define (solve bd) false)
```

Here it is a little bit tougher to think of a base case, so I’ll just use the defined above boards: “BD4”, “BD5” and “BD7”:

```racket
;; Tests:
(check-expect (solve BD4) BD4s)
(check-expect (solve BD5) BD5s)
(check-expect (solve BD7) false)
```

Template:

```racket
;; Template:
#; (define (solve bd)
     (local [(define (solve--board bd)
               (if (solved? bd) ; trivial?
                   bd
                   (solve--lobd (next-boards bd)))) ; next-problem

             (define (solve--lobd lobd)
               (cond [(empty? lobd) false]
                     [else
                      (local [(define try (solve--board (first lobd)))] 
                        (if (not (false? try))
                            try
                            (solve--lobd (rest lobd))))]))]
    
       (solve--board bd)))
```

What I have done is to generate an arbitrary-arity tree by, for each board, finding the valid next boards and throwing out, immediately the invalid ones. We’ll just do a backtracking search over that tree as we go. And if we ever come to a full board, a board that is solved, we’re done. Every time we fail, every time we run out of choices, we produce false. That’s the code of the Sudoku solver.

The template is: what we know about the body of the function based on what it consumes and produces and it’s basic behavior before we get to the details.

## Sudoku — Making the Wish List

[sudoku--makingWishList.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--makingWishList/sudoku--makingWishList.no-image.rkt)

The two functions we wished for but didn’t define are “solved” and “next-boards”. So let’s go ahead and do wish list entries for those.

```racket
;; Board -> Boolean
;; produce true if board, bd, is solved
;; NOTE: board is valid, so it is solved if it is full
;; !!!

;; Stub:
(define (solved? bd) false)

;; Board -> (listof Board)
;; produce list of valid next boards from board, bd
;; finds first empty square, fills it with Natural[1, 9], keeps only the valid boards
;; !!!

;; Stub:
(define (next-boards bd) empty)
```

## Sudoku — Making the Wish List Come True Part 1

[sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue-01/sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue.no-image.rkt)

From here on out, it’s just straightforward how to design functions recipe and wish list management until we’ve got everything done. Starting with “solved?”:

```racket
;; Board -> Boolean
;; produce true if board, bd, is solved
;; NOTE: board is valid, so it is solved if it is full

;; Stub:
#; (define (solved? bd) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (solved? BD1) false)
(check-expect (solved? BD2) false)
(check-expect (solved? BD4) false)
(check-expect (solved? BD4s) true)
(check-expect (solved? BD5) false)
(check-expect (solved? BD5s) true)
(check-expect (solved? BD6) false)

;; Template:
#; (define (solved? bd)
     (cond [(empty? bd) (...)]
           [else (and (is (first bd) not B - blank)
                      (solved? (rest bd)))]))
;; this is possible because, in Racket, the 'and' function short-circuits its evaluation
;; this means that if any of its arguments evaluates '#f', it immediately returns '#f'

#;(define (solved? bd)
  (cond [(empty? bd) true]
        [else(and (not (false? (read-square bd 0)))
                  (solved? (rest bd)))]))

;; or we can use a built-in abstract function

;; Template:
#; (define (solved? bd)
     (andmap ... bd))

(define (solved? bd)
  (local [(define (predicate s) (not (false? s)))]
  (andmap predicate bd)))
```

Moving on, let’s work on “next-boards”. Signature, purpose, stub and tests:

```racket
;; Board -> (listof Board)
;; produce list of valid next boards from board, bd
;; finds first empty square, fills it with Natural[1, 9], keeps only the valid boards

;; Stub:
#; (define (next-boards bd) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (next-boards BD1)
              (list (cons 1 (rest BD1)) (cons 2 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 3 (rest BD1)) (cons 4 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 5 (rest BD1)) (cons 6 (rest BD1))

                    (cons 9 (rest BD1))))

```

We can also use function composition, although this option ends up having worst performance, since we will have to generate all new boards, filling previously computed position with all Natural numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive), and only then filter them, when in my solution, only the valid boards would be added to the resulting list, saving one pass through: (list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8).

```racket
;; or we can use function composition - this option having worst performance

(define (next-boards bd)
  (keep-only-valid (fill-with-1-9 (find-blank bd) bd)))

;; Board -> Pos
;; produces the position of the first blank square
;; ASSUME: the board has at least one blank square
;; !!!

;; Stub:
(define (find-blank bd) 0)

;; Pos Board -> (listof Board)
;; produce 9 boards, with blank filled with Natural[1, 9]
;; !!!

;; Stub:
(define (fill-with-1-9 p bd) empty)

;; (listof Board) -> (listof Board)
;; produce list containing only valid boards
;; !!!

;; Stub:
(define (keep-only-valid lobd) empty)
```

## Making the Wish List Come True Part 2

[sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue-02/sudoku--makingWishListComeTrue.no-image.rkt)

Starting with: “find-blank”:

```racket
;; Board -> Pos
;; produces the position of the first blank square
;; ASSUME: the board has at least one blank square

;; Stub:
#; (define (find-blank bd) 0)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (find-blank BD1) 0)
(check-expect (find-blank (cons 2 (rest BD1))) 1)
(check-expect (find-blank (cons 2 (cons 4 (rest (rest BD1))))) 2)

;; Template:
#; (define (find-blank bd)
     (cond [(empty? bd) (...)]
           [else (... (first bd)
                      (find-blank (rest bd)))]))

(define (find-blank bd)
  (cond [(empty? bd) (error "The board didn't have a blank sapce.")]
        [else (if (false? (first bd))
                  0
                  (+ 1 (find-blank (rest bd))))]))
```

Now, we’re going to do “fill-with-1-9”:

```racket
;; Pos Board -> (listof Board)
;; produce 9 boards, with blank filled with Natural[1, 9]

;; Stub:
#; (define (fill-with-1-9 p bd) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (fill-with-1-9 0 BD1)
              (list (cons 1 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 2 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 3 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 4 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 5 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 6 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 7 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 8 (rest BD1))
                    (cons 9 (rest BD1))))

;; Template:
#; (define (fill-with-1-9 p bd)
     (build-list 9 ...))

(define (fill-with-1-9 p bd)
  (local [(define (build-one n)
            (fill-square bd p (add1 n)))]
    (build-list 9 build-one)))
```

Let’s work on “keep-only-valid”:

```racket
;; (listof Board) -> (listof Board)
;; produce list containing only valid boards

;; Stub:
#; (define (keep-only-valid lobd) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (keep-only-valid (list (cons 1 (cons 1 (rest (rest BD1)))))) empty)

;; Template:
#; (define (keep-only-valid lobd)
     (filter ... lobd))

(define (keep-only-valid lobd)
  (filter valid-board? lobd))

;; Board -> Boolean
;; produce true if no unit on the board has the same value twice; otherwise false

;; Stub:
(define (valid-board? bd) false)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (valid-board? BD1) true)
(check-expect (valid-board? BD2) true)
(check-expect (valid-board? BD3) true)
(check-expect (valid-board? BD4) true)
(check-expect (valid-board? BD5) true)
(check-expect (valid-board? (cons 2 (rest BD2))) false)
(check-expect (valid-board? (cons 2 (rest BD3))) false)
(check-expect (valid-board? (fill-square BD4 1 6)) false)
```

## Sudoku — Making the Wish List Come True Part 3

What’s left is the design of “valid-board”. This is paradoxically the hardest function in the whole program, but by working systematically we can get there bit by bit.

```racket
;; Template
#; (define (valid-board? bd)
     (valid-units? UNITS))

(define (valid-board? bd)
  (local [;; (listof Unit) -> Boolean
          ;; produce true if every unit of given list of units is valid

          (define (valid-units? lou)
            (andmap valid-unit? lou))

          
          ;; Unit -> Boolean
          ;; produce true if given unit is valid
          ;; valid means that unit does not have the same value twice

          (define (valid-unit? u)
            (no-duplicates? (keep-only-values (read-unit u))))

          
          ;; Unit -> (listof Val|false)
          ;; produce contents of bd at given unit, u

          (define (read-unit u)
            (map read-pos u))

This is, performance wise, worst than my solution, because we are making a lot of unnecessary passes through every square of the board.

> In this problem set you will design a program to check whether a given simple maze is solvable. Note that you are operating on VERY SIMPLE mazes, specifically:
> 
> - all of your mazes will be square
> - the maze always starts in the upper left corner and ends in the lower right corner
> - at each move, you can only move down or right
> 
> Design a representation for mazes, and then design a function that consumes a maze and produces true if the maze is solvable, false otherwise.
> 
> Solvable means that it is possible to start at the upper left, and make it all the way to the lower right. Your final path can only move down or right one square at a time. BUT, it is permissible to backtrack if you reach a dead end.
> 
> For example, the first three mazes below are solvable.  Note that the fourth is not solvable because it would require moving left. In this solver you only need to support moving down and right! Moving in all four directions introduces complications we are not yet ready for.

> Your function will of course have a number of helpers. Use everything you have learned so far this term to design this program.
> 
> One big hint. Remember that we avoid using an image based representation of information unless we have to. So the above are RENDERINGs of mazes. You should design a data definition that represents such mazes, but don't use images as your representation.

### Question 46: N Queens

> This project involves the design of a program to solve the n queens puzzle.

> 
> The n queens problem consists of finding a way to place n chess queens on a n by n chess board while making sure that none of the queens attack each other.
> 
> The BOARD consists of n^2 individual SQUARES arranged in 4 rows of 4 columns.
> The colour of the squares does not matter. Each square can either be empty or can contain a queen.
> 
> A POSITION on the board refers to a specific square.
> 
> A queen ATTACKS every square in its row, its column, and both of its diagonals.

> - You should design a function that consumes a natural - N - and
> tries to find a solution.
> 
> NOTE 1: You can tell whether two queens are on the same diagonal by comparing the slope of the line between them. If one queen is at row and column (r1, c1) and another queen is at row and column (r2, c2) then the slope of the line between them is: (/ (- r2 r1) (- c2 c1)).  If that slope is 1 or -1 then the queens are on the same diagonal.

;; The N-queens Problem

;; In the current file, we have a group of functions that solve and render the
;; solutions for a problem based on the game of chess. In chess, a queen can
;; attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The N-queens problem asks:
;;  - How can N queens be placed on an NxN chessboard so that no two of them
;;    attack each other?

;; The board consists of n^2 individual squares arranged in n rows and n columns.
;; The color of the squares does not matter. Each square can either be empty or
;; can contain a queen. A position on the board refers to a specific square.
;; A queen attacks every square in its row, column, and both of its diagonals.
;; A board is valid if none of the queens placed on it attack each other.
;; A valid board is solved if it contains n queens.

;; For solving N-queens, backtracking, generative recursion, and arbitrarity
;; arity trees will be used. The function responsible for finding the solution
;; for this problem should consume a natural.

;; =================
;; Data Definitions:

;; Square is Boolean
;; interp. a square is a single space in the board which can be empty, represented
;;         with the Boolean false, or it can contain a queen, represented with
;;         the Boolean true. Each square has a position on the board (defined below).

;; Template:
#; (define (fn-for-square s)
     (... s))

;; Board is (listof Square)
;; interp. visually a board is a n^2 array of squares, where each square has a row
;;         and column number, (r, c). But we represent it as a single flat list,
;;         in which the rows are layed out one after another in a linear fashion.
;;         Any board's length is a perfect square, therefore it starts at 1, which
;;         means that no Board can be: empty.

;; Template:
#; (define (fn-for-board b)
     (cond [(empty? b) (...)]
           [else
            (... (fn-for-square (first b))
                 (fn-for-board (rest b)))]))

;; Position is Natural[0, n^2 - 1]
;; interp. the position of a square on the board. Since any boards length is n^2,
;;         the position range goes up to n^2, because it is 0-indexed. The row
;;         number is the quotient of the position, p, by n, the board's side length.
;;         The column number is the remainder of the division of p by n.

;; Template:
#; (define (fn-for-position p)
     (... p))

(define-struct coords (col row))
;; Coordinates is (make-coords Natural Natural)
;; interp. the coordinates of a square on the board. Both the col and row range from
;;         [0, n), because row and column are 0-indexed. See Position for how to
;;         convert Position to row and column indexes.

;; Template:
#; (define (fn-for-coords c)
     (... (coords-col c)
          (coords-row c)))

[merge-sort.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-10b/modules/week-10b/videoContest/merge-sort.rkt)

I’m going to design a program to implement merge sort. Merge sort is a generative recursion sort algorithm. And the way it works is by breaking the given list into parts; sorting the parts and merging them back together.

```racket
;; Merge Sort

;; Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the
;; principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list
;; into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and
;; merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. It was
;; invented by John Von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis
;; of bottom-up merge sort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Von Neumann
;; as early as 1948.

;; The concept of Divide and Conquer involves three steps:
;;   1. Divide the problem into multiple subproblems.
;;   2. Solve the Sub Problems. The idea is to break down the problem into
;;      atomic subproblems, where they are actually solved.
;;   3. Combine the solutions of the subproblems to find the solution of the
;;      actual problem.

;; So, the merge sort working rule involves the following steps:
;;   1. Divide the unsorted array into subarray, each containing a single
;;      element.
;;   2. Take adjacent pairs of two single element array and merge them to form
;;      an array of two elements.
;;   3. Repeat the process till a single sorted array is obtained.

;; An array of size, n, is divided into two parts, n/2 size of each. Then those
;; arrays are further divided till we reach a single element. The base case here
;; is reaching one single elemtnt. When the base case is hit, we start merging
;; the left part and the right part and we get a sorted array at the end. Merge
;; sort repeatedly breaks down an array into several subarrays until each
;; subarray consists of a single element and merging those subarrays in a
;; manner that results in a sorted array.

;; Merge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists
;; as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the lements of
;; the inputs lists in sorted order.

# 11: Accumulators

## Module Overview

The rules we have been using to generate structural recursion templates are very powerful. They make it easy to write functions that traverse complex data collecting information at every place in that data. The power of these rules is highlighted by our ability to design abstract fold functions for recursive and mutually recursive types.

But the structural recursion templates have one problem: while they make it easy for our functions to see each "place" in the structure once we get to it, they do not allow us to see two kinds of important contextual information. One has to do with where our function has already been in the traversal, and the other has to do with work remaining to be done once each recursive call to our function produces its result. To paraphrase the song, "we know where we are, but we don't know where we've been or where we still need to go".

Accumulators allow us to solve these problems. There are three types of accumulators: context preserving, result so far and worklist. The latter two are used in different ways to make functions tail-recursive, which is important when we design recursive functions that traverse very large data. All three kinds of accumulators are supported by a few small additions to the HtDF recipe.

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify when a function design requires the use of accumulator.
- Be able to work with the accumulator design recipe to design such functions.
- Understand and be able to explain the concepts of tail position, tail call and tail recursion.

## Context Preserving Accumulators

[contextPreservingAccumulators.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-11/modules/week-11/contextPreservingAccumulators/contextPreservingAccumulators.no-image.rkt)

We’re going to look at another kind of design element called an accumulator. There are three basic ways to use accumulators. The first kind of accumulator we’re going to look at is called a context preserving accumulator- preserves context that otherwise gets lost in structural recursion.

> Design a function that consumes a list of elements and produces the list consisting of only the 1st, 3rd, 5th and so on elements of its input.
> 
> 
> (skip1 (list "a" "b" "c" "d")) should produce (list "a" "c")
> 

We’re going to start out pretending we don’t know this function requires an accumulator.

```racket
;; (listof X) -> (listof X)
;; produce list consisting of only the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... elements of given list, lox

;; Stub:
(define (skip1 lox) empty)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (skip1 (list "a" "b" "c" "d")) (list "a" "c"))
(check-expect (skip1 (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)) (list 1 3 5))

;; Template: <used template for (listof X)>
(define (skip1 lox)
  (cond [(empty? lox) empty]
        [else
         (if (odd? POSITION-OF-FIRST-LOX)
             (cons (first lox)
                   (skip1 (rest lox)))
             (skip1 (rest lox)))]))
```

Since this function operates on any X, it cannot contain a function which operates on a specific type. We don’t know what that “POSITION-OF-FIRST-LOX” is. In some sense, at the beginning, that position is 1, but by the time we get to the next element, we don’t know the position anymore.

This context information about how far we are is lost in the structural recursion template. We need a way to preserve the context of how far we’ve gone. This is a classic context preserving accumulator problem. To generate an accumulator template we follow this 3 parts:

1. Structural recursion template.
2. Wrapping function in outer function, local and trampoline.
3. Adding additional accumulator parameter.

```racket
;; Template: <used template for (listof X)>
(define (skip1 lox0)
  (local [(define (skip1 lox acc)
            ;; acc: Natural; 1-based position of (first lox) in lox0 ; accumulator invariant
            (cond [(empty? lox) (... acc)]
                  [else
                   (... acc
                       (first lox)
                       (skip1 (rest lox) (... acc)))]))]

    (skip1 lox0 ...)))
```

That is kind of a signature and purpose for the parameter “acc”. To do the examples, work out the progression of calls to the inner function.

We’re using the accumulator type and invariant to figure out the examples for the accumulator, like we used the signature and purpose of a function to figure out the examples for the function.

```racket
;; Template: <used template for (listof X)>
(define (skip1 lox0)
  ;; acc: Natural; 1-based position of (first lox) in lox0

  ;; Examples:
  ;; (skip1 (list "a" "b" "c") 1)
  ;; (skip1 (list     "b" "c") 2)
  ;; (skip1 (list         "c") 3)
  
  (local [(define (skip1 lox acc)
            (cond [(empty? lox) empty]
                  [else
                   (if (odd? acc)
                       (cons (first lox) (skip1 (rest lox) (add1 acc)))
                       (skip1 (rest lox) (add1 acc)))]))]

    (skip1 lox0 1)))
```

When we’re filling in the details there’s always three things we need to do with the accumulator:

- Provide initial value or initialize it: (skip1 lox0 1).
- Exploit/use the value of the accumulator, in other words, take advantage of the fact that the comment, that says what the accumulator represents, is right: (odd? acc).
- Update accumulator to preserve invariant, the fact that we’ve set about the it: (add1 acc).

Accumulator invariant: something that’s always true about the accumulator - even though the value changes, because it changes as we go along, there’s something about it which doesn’t change. The accumulator is a varying quantity about which some fact does not change, does not vary.

## Tail Recursion

[tailRecursion.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-11/modules/week-11/tailRecursion/tailRecursion.no-image.rkt)

[tailRecursion.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-11/modules/week-11/tailRecursion/tailRecursion.png)

We’re going to start looking at a second way to use accumulators, which is to make a recursive function, or a set of mutually recursive functions tail recursive. First we have to understand what tail recursion means, and why it matters.

> (A) Consider the following function that consumes a list of numbers and produces
the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use the stepper to analyze the behavior
of this function as the list gets larger and larger.
> 
> 
> (B) Use an accumulator to design a tail-recursive version of sum.
> 

```racket
;; (listof Number) -> Number
;; produce sum of all elements of lon

;; Stub:
#; (define (sum lon) 0)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (sum empty) 0)
(check-expect (sum (list 2 4 5)) 11)

;; Template: <used template for (listof Number)>
(define (sum lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (+ (first lon)
            (sum (rest lon)))]))

(sum (list 1 2 3 4 5))
```

By doing part (A), when we are done processing all the elements in the array, through recursion,this is what the stepper shows is happening:

```racket
(+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 (+ 5 0)))))
```

What we can see here is we’ve got all these pluses built up, waiting to happen. And then kind of at the very end, we end up with 15. What happens as the list gets long? As the list gets long, this pending computation, this set of pluses that are waiting to happen, is going to get longer and longer. Does this matter?

It turns out it does matter for the following reason, which is that what DrRacket has to do to make ISL programs run quickly, what any programming language has to do to make programs like this run quickly, is it stores this saved context. It stores this saved context in a special part of the computer’s memory called the stack, which happens to be very limited and expensive part of computer memory.

If we could find a way to add up long lists without using proportionally more stack, that would be better. Why did this get built up? The answer has to do with a couple of new concepts, known as tail position and a function call in tail position, and a recursive function call in tail position.

```racket
(+ (first lon)
   (sum (rest lon)))
```

This expression is in what’s called tail position. The result of this expression will be the result of the function. Whenever an expression is in a position where its result is the result of the enclosing function it is in tail position.

```racket
(first lon)
```

It’s not in tail position, its result is not the final result of the function; its result gets operated on by function “+” first.

```racket
(sum (rest lon))
```

This is not in tail position also, because whatever “sum” produces still has to get handed to “+” before it becomes the result of the enclosing call to “sum”. This recursive call, that is not in tail position is what causes the build up of growing context of pending operations, because all operands must be evaluated before the operator can operate. Therefore, the “+ 1” gets put in the stack as a pending operation while we go figure out the value of “sum(2 3 4 5)”, for example.

To avoid building up context of pending computation, we need to make a version of sum with the recursive call in tail position: a tail recursion version of sum. As data gets larger, the pending computations take up more and more of the stack: this is a problem.

```racket
;; Template: <used template for (listof Number) and Accumulator>
(define (sum lon0)
  (local [(define (sum lon acc)
            (cond [(empty? lon) (... acc)]
                  [else
                   (... acc
                        (first lon)
                        (sum (rest lon) (... acc)))]))]

    (sum lon0 ...)))
```

“(sum (rest lon) (... acc))” this needs to be the outermost call of the “else” answer to be in tail position. The “+” function cannot be waiting for sum to return.

```racket
;; Template: <used template for (listof Number) and Accumulator>
(define (sum lon0)
  ;; acc: Number; the sum of the elements of lon0 seen so far

  ;; Examples:
  ;; (sum (list 2 4 5))
  ;; (sum (list 2 4 5) 0)
  ;; (sum (list   4 5) 2)
  ;; (sum (list     5) 6)
  ;; (sum (list      ) 11)
  
  (local [(define (sum lon acc)
            (cond [(empty? lon) acc]
                  [else
                   (sum (rest lon)
                        (+ acc (first lon)))]))]

    (sum lon0 0)))
```

![Tail Recursion](./modules/week-11/tailRecursion/tailRecursion.png)

“foldr” is the not tail recursive, while “foldl” is the tail recursive abstract fold function for lists.

Making a function tail recursive using accumulator:

1. Template according to accumulator recipe.
2. Delete part of template wrapping around recursive call.
3. Computation that would have been around recursive call moves to be in accumulator argument position.

;The primary issue with the behavior of a non-tail-recursive function as the data
;gets larger and larger is the potential for stack overflow. In non-tail-recursive
;functions, each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. As the recursion
;deepens, the stack grows, and if the depth of the recursion becomes too large, it
;can lead to a stack overflow.
;
;When a stack overflow occurs, it means that the call stack has exceeded its
;available memory, and the program typically crashes. This limitation is inherent
;in many programming languages that rely on a call stack to manage function calls.
;
;Tail-recursive functions, on the other hand, have a special property called tail-call
;optimization (TCO). In a tail-recursive function, the recursive call is the last
;operation performed in the function, and TCO allows the compiler to optimize away
;the need for additional stack frames. This optimization essentially converts the
;recursion into an iterative process, preventing the stack from growing indefinitely
;and mitigating the risk of a stack overflow.
;
;In summary, the problem with non-tail-recursive functions, especially when dealing
;with large datasets, is the potential for stack overflow due to the accumulation
;of stack frames. Tail-recursive functions, with proper optimization, address this
;issue by eliminating the need for additional stack frames in each recursive call.

When adding an accumulator to mutually recursive functions, it needs to be added to all the functions.

## Worklist Accumulators - Part 2

[worklistAccumulators.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-11/modules/week-11/worklistAccumulators-02/worklistAccumulators.no-image.rkt)

> Design a function that consumes a wizard and produces the number of wizards in that tree (including the root). Your function should be tail recursive.
> 

```racket
;; Wizard -> Natural
;; produces the total number of wizards in the given wizard tree, w,
;; including the root

;; Stub:
#; (define (count w) 0)

;; Tests:
(check-expect (count Wa) 1)
(check-expect (count Wk) 11)
```

Oftentimes, when using an accumulator to achieve tail recursion, that accumulator ends up being the result so far.

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Wizard and for Context Preserving Accumulators>
(define (count w)
  ;; rsf is 
  (local [(define (fn-for--wizard w rsf)
            (... rsf
                 (wizard-name w)
                 (fn-for-house (wizard-house w))
                 (fn-for--low (wizard-children w) (... rsf))))

          (define (fn-for--low low rsf)
            (cond [(empty? low) (... rsf)]
                  [else
                   (... rsf
                        (fn-for--wizard (first low) (... rsf))
                        (fn-for--low (rest low) (... rsf)))]))]

    (fn-for--wizard w ...)))
```

We’re putting “(… rsf)”, because the result so far might have something to do with “rsf”; it might also have to do with the other elements: “(wiz-name, wiz-house, (first low), etc.)”, but we’re just putting “rsf” in for now.

The key thing about tail recursion in mutually recursive functions is that every single mutually recursive call has to be in tail position. In mutually recursive functions with accumulators, usually only one of the functions provides new values for each accumulator, not all of them.

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Wizard and for Context Preserving Accumulators>
(define (count w)
  ;; rsf is Natural; the number of wizards seen so far

  ;; Example:
  ;; (count Wk)
  
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wk 0)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wh 1)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wc 2)
  ;; ...
  
  (local [(define (fn-for--wizard w rsf)
            (... rsf
                 (wizard-name w)
                 (fn-for-house (wizard-house w))
                 (fn-for--low (wizard-children w) (add1 rsf))))

          (define (fn-for--low low rsf)
            (cond [(empty? low) (... rsf)]
                  [else
                   (+ (fn-for--wizard (first low) rsf)
                      (fn-for--low (rest low) rsf))]))]

    (fn-for--wizard w 0)))
```

This isn’t right, its not tail recursion because in “fn-for-low”, the results of “fn-for-wizard” and “fn-for-low” evaluations are operated on by the “+” function.

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Wizard and for Context Preserving Accumulators>
(define (count w)
  ;; rsf is Natural; the number of wizards seen so far

  ;; Example:
  ;; (count Wk)
  
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wk 0)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wh 1)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wc 2)
  ;; ...
  
  (local [(define (fn-for--wizard todo rsf) ;; todo is (listof Wizard)
            ;; wizards we still need to vist with fn-for-wizard
            (fn-for--low (wizard-children w) (add1 rsf)))

          (define (fn-for--low low rsf)
            (cond [(empty? low) rsf]
                  [else
                   (fn-for--wizard (first low) (rest low) rsf)]))]

    (fn-for--wizard w 0)))
```

There is a funny relationship between “rsf” and “todo” - “rsf” is every place we’ve seen, and “todo” is the things we’ve been told we should visit, but we haven’t visited them yet.

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Wizard and for Context Preserving Accumulators>
(define (count w)
  ;; rsf is Natural; the number of wizards seen so far

  ;; Example:
  ;; (count Wk)
  
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wk 0)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wh 1)
  ;; (fn-for-wiz Wc 2)
  ;; ...
  
  (local [(define (fn-for--wizard w todo rsf) ;; todo is (listof Wizard)
            ;; wizards we still need to vist with fn-for-wizard
            (fn-for--low (append (wizard-children w) todo)
                         (add1 rsf)))

          (define (fn-for--low todo rsf)
            (cond [(empty? todo) rsf]
                  [else
                   (fn-for--wizard (first todo) (rest todo) rsf)]))]

    (fn-for--wizard w empty 0)))
```

It’s now working. In a tail recursive traversal of an arbitrary arity tree, essentially each node, each wizard, calls the next one and it kind of goes through in a straight line until we get to the end.

What is the real order of the tree traversal?

```racket
Wk -> Wh -> Wc -> Wd -> Wi -> Wj -> We -> Wf -> Wb -> Wg -> Wa
```

What if, instead of: (append (wizard-children w) todo), we had: (append todo (wizard-children w))?

```racket
Wk -> Wh -> Wi -> Wj -> Wc -> Wd -> We -> Wf -> Wg -> Wb -> Wa
```

The first version of “append” produces what’s called depth first traversal of the tree - we go all the way down the leftmost branch to the end before we start going across. The second version of “append” produces breath first traversal - we go across a whole level before we go down.

One accumulator keeps track of the results so far and the other accumulator keeps track of all the children that we’ve seen but haven’t visited. In other words, everything that showed up in the “wizard-children” for a wizard we were at, but we haven’t yet gone to see them. It’s the pending work and that’s why its often called a worklist accumulator.

Now we have see three kinds of accumulators:

- Context-preserving accumulators (preserve context lost in natural recursion).
- Result-so-far accumulators (help achieve tail recursion by eliminating the need for pending operations).
- Worklist accumulators (help achieve tail recursion by eliminating the need to retain future recursive calls in pending operations).

> Design a new function definition for same-house-as-parent that is tail recursive. You will need a worklist accumulator.
> 

To traverse an arbitrary-arity tree with a tail recursive function, we need a worklist accumulator.

Thinking about the progression of the worklist accumulator values as we go through the traversal (using the first version of the “append” - depth first search). The worklist always has the rightmost part of the children at the front of it. Each call to “fn-for—low” leads to a call to “fn-for—wizard” on the first of the todo list.

There’s a little bit of a wrinkle to this problem - the caller, previous call to “fn-for--wizard” called “fn-for--low” with its house, which worked in the non-tail-recursive version. The call to “fn-for--wizard” with the parent, was in the call chain preceding the call to “fn-for--wizard” with the child, so it provided the correct parent house.

So, how are we going to work that? The worklist needs to include the parent house of each wizard on the worklist. Each entry on our worklist accumulator includes: the wizard to visit, together with that wizard’s parent house. The context-preserving accumulator is being incorporated into the worklist accumulator.

My version:

```racket
(define-struct work (parent-house wizard))
;; Work is (make-work (House | "") Wizard)
;; interp. a single element for worklist accumulator with wizard's parent-house
;;         parent-house can either be House or "", since the root wizard doesn't
;;         have a parent, it doesn't have a parent-house

;; Template:
#; (define (fn-for--work work)
     (... (work-parent-house work)
          (work-wizard work)))

;; Template: <used template from Wizard, from Work and for Worklist Accumulator>
(define (same-house-as-parent w)
  ;; rst is (listof String); names of wizards that have been visited with
  ;;                       ; fn-for--work and have the same House as their parents
  ;; wl is (listof Work); wizards we still need to visit with fn-for--work
  ;;                    ; and their parent's House

  (local [(define (fn-for--work work wl rst)
            (local [(define w (work-wizard work))
                    (define next-wl
                      (append (map
                               (λ (c) (make-work (wizard-house w) c))
                               (wizard-children w)) wl))]
              (if (string=? (wizard-house w) (work-parent-house work))
                  (fn-for--wl next-wl (append rst (list (wizard-name w))))
                  (fn-for--wl next-wl rst))))

          (define (fn-for--wl wl rst)
            (cond [(empty? wl) rst]
                  [else
                   (fn-for--work (first wl) (rest wl) rst)]))]

    (fn-for--work (make-work "" w) empty empty)))
```

In the arbitrarity-arity tree worklist, the function that operates on list, just gets it’s existing list parameter renamed. Sometimes we get a result-so-far accumulator where in the end, we have to do something to it. Although we have not yet used this in the course, we can put local define-structs in the “local” expression. 

The parent’s house in a worklist entry is not a context-preserving accumulator on its own, but it’s the context-preserving part of each worklist entry. Their version:

```racket
;; Template: <used template from Wizard, for Result-so-Far Accumulator,
;;            for Worklist Accumulator, and compount data definition
;;            for worklist entries>
(define (same-house-as-parent w)
  ;; todo is (listof ...); a worklist accumulator
  ;; rsf is (listof String); a result-so-far accumulator
  (local [(define-struct wle (w ph))
          ;; WLE (worklist entry) is (make-wle Wizard House)
          ;; interp. a worklist entry with the wizard to pass to fn-for--wizard
          ;;         and that wizard's parent house
          ;; NOTE: In case of the root wizard, we never create a wle with it;
          ;;       therefore any (wle-ph ...) will be of type House

          (define (fn-for--wizard w ph todo rsf)
            (fn-for--todo (append (map (λ (c) (make-wle c (wizard-house w)))
                                       (wizard-children w)) todo)
                          (if (string=? (wizard-house w) ph)
                              (append rsf (list (wizard-name w)))
                              rsf)))

          (define (fn-for--todo todo rsf)
            (cond [(empty? todo) rsf]
                  [else
                   (fn-for--wizard (wle-w (first todo)) (wle-ph (first todo))
                                   (rest todo) rsf)]))]

    (fn-for--wizard w "" empty empty)))
```

Code is more than just a bunch of characters. Code has structure. We use the word template to talk about some of the elements of that structure. It’s because I was able to think in terms of that structure, that this function was easy to write.

![Worklist Accumulators - Part 2](./modules/week-11/worklistAccumulators-02/worklistAccumulators.png)

The recipes, and in particular, the idea that every function can be based on one or more templates plus details enables you to thing about programs in terms of higher level structure or models.

# 12: Graphs

## Module Overview

Many forms of information naturally organize themselves into trees of various kinds. But what about transit maps, wiring diagrams, the internet, or even secret underground passages? Most of these have one or two key properties that make them be graphs instead of trees. One property is that there are more than one arrows that lead into some node, the other is that the arrows can form cycles.

Learning Goals:

- Be able to identify when domain information naturally forms a graph.
- Be able to write data definitions for graphs.
- Be able to construct cyclic data.
- Be able to design templates that operate on graphs, using accumulators to prevent chasing infinite cycles in the graph.
- Be able to design functions that operate on graphs.

## Introduction

There are two ways in which a graph can differ from an arbitrary-arity tree. One, is that they can have cycles. Cycles can be arbitrarily long. That are graphs without cycles - acyclic graphs. Two is that graphs can have multiple arrows going to a single node. We will be looking at directed graphs, meaning they have arrows that go in only one direction, and cyclic, meaning that cycles can exist.

## Constructing Cyclic Data

[constructingCyclicData.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-12/modules/week-12/constructingCyclicData/constructingCyclicData.no-image.rkt)

[constructingCyclicData.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-12/modules/week-12/constructingCyclicData/constructingCyclicData.rkt)

Graphs look a bit like arbitrary-arity trees. As in arbitrary-arity trees, in graphs, a node has:

- a name.
- zero or more paths to other nodes.

> Imagine you are suddenly transported into a mysterious house, in which all you can see is the name of the room you are in, and any doors that lead OUT of the room.  One of the things that makes the house so mysterious is that the doors only go in one direction. You can't see the doors that lead into the room.
> 
> 
> Here are some examples of such a house:
> 
> (open image file)
> (open image file)
> (open image file)
> (open image file)
> 
> In computer science, we refer to such an information structure as a directed graph. Like trees, in directed graphs the arrows have direction. But in a graph it is  possible to go in circles, as in the second example above. It is also possible for two arrows to lead into a single node, as in the fourth example.
> 
> Design a data definition to represent such houses. Also provide example data for the four houses above.

```racket
(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to

;; Examples:
; (open image file)
(define H1 (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" empty))))

; (open image file)
(define H2 (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list ...)))))
```

We would like to put the entire “make-room” expression for the room named “A” in that empty spot. Both “A” and “B” refer to each other - unlike a tree there’s no clear hierarchical structure where the parent contains children, but the children do not contain their parent. ISL, that has this notion of enclosing corresponding to the nesting of the parentheses, isn’t going to let us do this.

We’re going to switch to the last of the teaching languages called “advanced student”, that includes a special new construct called “shared”.

```racket
(define H2 (shared [(-0- (make-room
                          "A" (list (make-room
                                     "B" (list -0-)))))] -0-))
```

This “-0-” is a name for the result of the make-room expression for “A”. That name is going to be kind of a promise - it allows us to refer to this room later: even inside the expression that makes the room. What we wanted to put in the exits of “B” was the entire (make-room “A” …) expression and “-0-” is a name for the result of the (make-room “A” …) expression.

“-0-” is what the shared expression will produce, thus what “H2” will be. “-0-” is just another name for (make-room “A” …), so the value of “H2”, like the value of “H1” is (make-room “A” …). “-0-” is a special name for the result of the (make-room “A” …) expression which we’ll be able to use in circular structure. “-0-” is the “special promise name” for (make-room “A” …), that we can use in circular data; it can be used to make “back-arrows”.

Instead of trying to read the shared expression that racket shows us, what we can do is:

```racket
> H2
(shared ((-0- (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list -0-)))))) -0-)
> (room-name H2)
"A"
> (length (room-exits H2))
1
> (map room-name (room-exits H2))
(list "A")
```

We can read the more complicated structure if we think of the promise names as basically making cycles back in the structure. Or we can use selectors to pick the structure apart and understand it that way. Both are valid.

```racket
; (open image file)
#; (define H3 (shared [(-0- (make-room
                           "A" (list (make-room
                                      "B" (list (make-room
                                                 "C" (list -0-)))))))] -0-))

(define H3 (shared [(-A- (make-room "A" (list -B-)))
                    (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C-)))
                    (-C- (make-room "C" (list -A-)))]
             -A-))
```

If we went on the interactions area and asked to look at H3, Racket shows us this upper version of how to textually represent the value:

```racket
> H3
(shared ((-0- (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list (make-room "C" (list -0-))))))))
  -0-)
```

In some sense, what it is trying to do is use as few labels as it can, rather than use as many labels as it can. One important thing here is cyclical structure doesn’t show up in text very well. This is a property of cyclical structure, not of this language’s representation of if. In fact, Racket is showing this cyclical structure in a much easier to understand way than most other languages do. It’s cyclical structure that’s complicated, not the way languages show it.

```racket

Using shared, we can use these little temporary labels to textually represent cyclic structure.

## Templating

[templating.no-image.rkt](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-12/modules/week-12/templating/templating.no-image.rkt)

[templating.png](https://github.com/squxq/How-to-Code-Complex-Data/blob/week-12/modules/week-12/templating/templating.png)

We have learned about graphs, we’ve written a type comment which looks exactly like the type comment for an arbitrary-arity tree, and we’ve learned a new construct “shared” that lets us construct cyclical structure.

```racket
;; Template: <structural recursion, encapsulate with local,
;;            tail recursive with worklist, context-preserving accumulator
;;            what rooms have we already visited>
```

We’re designing the template at a model level, rather than thinking about individual characters of program text. Any function operating on a “house graph” will require all these elements in its template.

```racket
(define (fn-for-house r0)
  ;; todo is (listof Room)
  ;; INVARIANT: worklist accumulator
  
  (local [(define (fn-for-room r todo)
            (fn-for-lor (append (room-exits r) todo))) ; (room-name r)
          
          (define (fn-for-lor todo)
            (cond [(empty? todo) (...)]
                  [else
                   (fn-for-room (first todo)
                                (rest todo))]))]
    (fn-for-room r0 empty)))
```

This version will go around in circles forever because it doesn’t check whether the room has already been visited.

```racket
(define (fn-for-house r0)
  ;; todo is (listof Room)
  ;; INVARIANT: worklist accumulator

  ;; visited is (listof String)
  ;; INVARIANT: context-preserving accumulator, names of rooms already visited
  ;; ASSUME: room names are unique
  
  (local [(define (fn-for-room r todo visited)
            (if (member (room-name r) visited)
                (fn-for-lor todo visited)
                (fn-for-lor (append (room-exits r) todo)
                            (cons (room-name r) visited)))) ; (... (room-name r))
          
          (define (fn-for-lor todo visited)
            (cond [(empty? todo) (...)]
                  [else
                   (fn-for-room (first todo)
                                (rest todo)
                                visited)]))]
    (fn-for-room r0 empty empty)))
```

## Problem: reachable?

> (reachable? H1 "C") produces false

> But note that if you defined H4F to be the room named F in the H4 house than (reachable? H4F "A") would produce false because it is not possible to get to A from F in that house.

```racket
(define H4F (shared [(-A- (make-room "A" (list -B- -D-)))
                     (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C- -E-)))
                     (-C- (make-room "C" (list -B-)))

                     (-F- (make-room "F" empty))]
              -F-))

;; =====================

  ;; todo is (listof Room)
  ;; INVARIANT: worklist accumulator

  ;; visited is (listof String)
  ;; INVARIANT: context-preserving accumulator, names of rooms already visited
  ;; ASSUME: room names are unique
  
  (local [(define (fn-for-room r todo visited)
            (if (string=? (room-name r) rn)
                true 
                (if (member (room-name r) visited)
                    (fn-for-lor todo visited)
                    (fn-for-lor (append (room-exits r) todo)
                                (cons (room-name r) visited)))))
          
          (define (fn-for-lor todo visited)
            (cond [(empty? todo) false]
                  [else
                   (fn-for-room (first todo)
                                (rest todo)
                                visited)]))]
    (fn-for-room r0 empty empty)))
```

If we’ve found what we’re looking for, produce true; else do the usual visited check and keep going through the worklist. Using higher-level design concepts breaks down complicated problems to a point where we can solve them systematically and simply.
